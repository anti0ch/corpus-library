    ROLL: ""Helen’s Wits"" [3] = 3

Helen bumps over another pothole as she drives through the streets of Lindstrom. The streets here are terrible...she's pretty sure she's hit more potholes during the last forty minutes than the entire rest of the time that she's been in Sicol Bend.

She hasn't spotted Ghetto G-sus, but she's seen a few other people out and about. They're almost landmarks at this point, given the number of times that she's passed them. Old man mowing his lawn, girl riding her bike up and down the block, boy playing with his iPhone...

Dol|Helen

Normally Helen would sigh to herself and bemoan how much of her precious time is being wasted to anyone who would listen, but today is different. She continues driving, splitting her attention between the road, her search for the vigilante, and her mental complaints. For today she had nothing better to do than to try and talk to one of the odder capes in town. The same was true of tomorrow.

Her customary frown deepens into a scowl at the idea that her time has been so thoroughly devalued. Being removed from the hospital, after her whole life had been spent trying to get to it, was a blow to her ego.

She had other things she could do, though. With any luck, Ghetto G-sus would show up soon enough that she could stop thinking about how frustrating her situation is.

Who the hell thought it would be a good idea for her to 'recuperate' from Owen's disappearance by spending all of her time at home, alone, anyways?

Teller|GM

As if in response to her thoughts - though, admittedly, she had been thinking of little else - a man suddenly appears in front of her vehicle, about twenty feet away. A heavyset black man, the sort of person whose head would probably look too large for their body if they were thinner. His skin is smooth and soft looking, including the top of his bald head.

He wears no mask, only an admittedly stylish white tracksuit and trainers.

Even if his display of power didn't give it away, the man is evidently Ghetto G-sus. He keeps his hands in his pockets and squints at her in the bright afternoon sun, trying to make out her face through the windshield.

Dol|Helen

Helen slams on the brakes, startled and not wanting to hit the man. She knew he would recover if he died, but she certainly didn't want to be one of the people who made him do so. Helen knew she was lacking in social charms, but Owen had been very clear that running people over was not the way to make a good first impression.

Even if Helen still thought that caterer deserved it.

Teller|GM

She comes to a stop. Ghetto G-sus takes his time walking over to the car, then leans forward, resting his hands on the edge of the window. ""Nice whip.""

Dol|Helen

Helen glares at the non-chalant cape.

After a poignant moment of expression she asks, ""Whip?""

Teller|GM

He looks the tiniest bit disappointed. ""Nice car, is what I'm sayin'.""

""I heard you've been driving it through here for the past half hour. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you're not dealing...so what's up?""

Dol|Helen

""Oh, uh, thank you,"" Helen awkwardly replies, glancing at her car to assess it. It wasn't as impressive as cars Helen might have owned, but she still liked it well enough.

""I wanted to talk,"" she answers, looking back to the cape, ""With you.""

After a moment's pause she adds, almost as an afterthought, ""Over lunch? My treat.""

Teller|GM

""Lunch?"" His eyes light up, then he catches himself. ""I'm always down for free food, but mama had a lot to say about going places with strangers. How about we get acquainted first?""

""Ghetto G-sus at your service, baby,"" he says, giving a small mock bow. ""Who are you, and what'd you want to talk to me about?""

Dol|Helen

Helen was not convinced she liked this person, but she still needed to try.

""Helen,"" she introduces herself, bowing her head slightly to the cape while only slightly clenching her jaw.

""Helen Willis-Troy.""

Teller|GM

""Aight, Helen,"" Ghetto G-sus says. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to have anything to say about her name. ""What'd you want to talk about?""

Dol|Helen

Helen frowns, having not wanted to bring the situation up like that. If she had to in order to get the conversation, though, she would. Ugh, she's really letting her principles slide.

""Deep-Six.""

He might not want to talk about it, though, and he had seemed excited for the lunch; Helen was trying to be nice.

She sighs, then continues, ""Lunch can happen either way.""

Teller|GM

He looks at her questioningly, as if staring at her hard enough will let him figure her out. ""I've talked to a lot of people about that motherfucker. What's he to you?""

Dol|Helen

Helen meets his gaze, unafraid of being figured out.

""The reason I'm widowed,"" she answers, doing her level best to sound stoic about it.

Teller|GM

""Damn,"" Ghetto G-sus says, swearing apologetically. ""I'm sorry for your loss.""

""Lunch, huh?"" he muses. ""I was actually on my way somewhere...but why don't you come with? We can talk there.""

Dol|Helen

That caught Helen somewhat off guard. Hadn't he been excited for lunch?

""Certainly,"" she replies, ""Did you want a ride?""

Being nice was going okay so far, despite how stressful it is.

Teller|GM

He suddenly appears next to her in the passenger seat, a small smirk on his face. ""Sure thing. 's not far. You're going to want to drive two blocks, then take a right.""

Dol|Helen

""Buckle your seat belt,"" Helen tells the cape. The law was the law, regardless of whether you can come back from death or not.

She'd follow his instructions once he minded the rules of her car.

Teller|GM

He laughs out loud at this, but does as she says. ""You're alright, Willis.""

As they begin moving, he looks like he's had a minorly devastating realization, and looks out of the passenger window. They bounce over another pothole.

She's getting more attention than she did earlier. A few people noticed her talking with the cape earlier, and even more notice now that he's riding shotgun in her 'whip'.

Dol|Helen

""Everything alright, Ghetto G-sus?"" Helen asks, trying to show an interest in the man's well being. She focuses on her driving as she talks, not wanting to hit too many potholes.

""You seem a little distraught. I'm not that kind of doctor, but I'm told talking about it helps.""

Not that Helen had a lot of respect for that kind of doctor. The obvious solution to missing someone was to talk about them, and spend even more of your time thinking about how much you miss them. Maybe prompting Ghetto G-sus to talk about his problems was a mistake?

Oh well, too late now.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Dexterity"" [3] +2 = 5

Teller|GM

She manages to avoid the worst of the potholes, but the car still jostles every once in awhile. These streets are truly terrible.

""Nah, it's nothing,"" he says. ""Just...you ever watch Diff'rent Strokes?""

Dol|Helen

""That was a TV show, wasn't it?"" Helen answers, honestly not knowing. ""I watch a movie every now and again, but mostly just old black and white films.""

Why had he brought this up?

Teller|GM

""Yeah, didn't think so,"" Ghetto G-sus says, the same tiny hint of disappointment in his voice as before. ""Don't worry 'bout it.""

As they turn the corner, the smell of cooking meat and burning charcoal wafts into the car. He points to a home a few houses down, where there are already a handful of cars parked. ""That house right there.""

Dol|Helen

Helen turns to the house and starts looking for a place to park. She wasn't sure what to do about having disappointed Ghetto G-sus. She wasn't even sure how she had disappointed Ghetto G-sus.

People are strange.

""Is the show good?"" She asks, trying for socializing. She was hoping for information, but really not sure how to get it.

Teller|GM

By the time she asks the question, Ghetto G-sus has vanished. He's now standing on the lawn of the house a few feet away, and doesn't seem to have heard her. ""Come on back.""

Dol|Helen

Hm. That was kind of an annoying habit. She finishes things with her car, then moves to join Ghetto G-sus on the lawn.

Maybe he wasn't much for conversation.

Teller|GM

He leads her around the side of the home, pushing aside a chain link gate as he does so. A large yellow dog bounds across the yard to meet them, running around Ghetto G-sus excitedly. It then races around Helen, sniffing her inquisitively.

There are fourteen, fifteen people in the yard. Adults sitting at fold out tables, talking and eating. Kids of various ages are running around underfoot, some throwing a foam football around and tackling each other, others who seem to be just running around and screaming for the sake of it. A handful of older kids and one older woman are sitting to the side, playing cards.

""Double G!"" The man at the grill yells out in greeting. Heads turn to look. He's taller than Ghetto G-sus, but skinnier. ""I'd ask what kept you, but I see you've been spending time with your new girlfriend.""

""Nah,"" Ghetto G-sus says. He vanishes for a second, intercepts the foam football out of midair, and then reappears next to Helen. ""I don't think she can handle all of this.""

He look like he's about to add much, much more, but then he just smiles and winks at her. ""Eric, Helen. Helen, Eric.""

Dol|Helen

""Pleasure to meet you, Eric,"" Helen tells the tall grilling man, offering him a polite wave.

She quickly scowls at ""Double G"", frustrated at her inability to follow his moods. She didn't have a lot of success in getting along with other people, but most of them don't flaunt it quite as much as Ghetto G-sus seems to.

She tries to seem, if not pleasant, less unpleasant for the gathered crowd. Ghetto G-sus had tricked her into attending a party.

Maybe she'd get lucky and someone would choke; then she could cathartically stab them to clear their airway.

Teller|GM

Ghetto G-sus throws the football back to a small girl with braids, who immediately gets tackled by a larger girl. He winces, then grabs a sturdy paper plate. He begins piling food onto it, mostly meat and a potato salad.

""Thank God you're here,"" Eric says to Ghetto G-sus. ""Someone has to eat that potato salad, and it might as well be someone that can't be killed.""

""Don't think I can't hear you, Eric!"" a woman calls from across the yard. A few people laugh. They all seem at ease with Ghetto G-sus' presence, as well as Helen's.

""So, how do you know Double G, here?"" Eric says to Helen. ""Are you a cape too?""

    ROLL: ""Helen’s Social"" [4] -1 = 3

He glances at Ghetto G-sus, then nods towards the stack of plates. ""Grab a plate, Helen, we have more than enough. I just wouldn't touch the salad, if I were you.""

Dol|Helen

Helen flusters. She never knew how to handle people, especially when she was supposed to be friendly. Why was everything in her life reminding her of Owen?

He was usually the one to handle social situations; Helen had always just avoided them outright before they'd started dating.

She really misses her work.

Teller|GM

There is a small mountain of food on Ghetto G-sus's plate. He teleports over to a table, places the plate down carefully, then teleports back to fill back up a second plate.

Eric looks at her hesitantly, then shrugs when she doesn't answer. ""Sorry, nevermind, maybe I shouldn't have asked?""

There are eyes on her now. People are looking, while trying their best to keep talking and pretend that they're not looking.

Dol|Helen

Ah, crap.

She tries to answer everything in order.

""No, we only just met. I was hoping to talk with him. The potato salad looks fine. I apologize, parties aren't my usual thing.""

She does her best not to fidget, trying to seem calm and composed.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [2] -1 = 1

Teller|GM

""Yeah, cool,"" Eric says, nodding. He seems at a loss for anything else to say, and turns back to the grill. Ghetto G-sus begins walking over to the table with his second plate, and gestures for Helen to follow.

""You just aren't used to cookouts with black people, are you?"" the old woman playing card asks. She laughs to herself. ""We don't bite, honey.""

""Grandmaaaa,"" one of the boys at the table groans, putting his face in his hands.

Dol|Helen

""I'm not used to people at all,"" Helen admits, hoping to ease some of the stress she was feeling via honesty.

She moves to follow Ghetto G-sus, hoping that things veer closer to her comfort zone sometime soon.

Maybe someone would have a heart attack?

Teller|GM

Ghetto G-sus sits down across the table. The look on his face again suggests he's trying to figure her out. The he nods to himself, looking satisfied. ""Yeah, they woulda sent someone who can actually fuckin' hang.""

When he starts talking to her, the other people at the cookout take that as their cue to butt out of the conversation. They return to talking to each other, though they still glance over occasionally.

""Sorry about the 'surprise party', but a brother can't be too careful,"" he says. ""First rule of being a hero: Don't do what they expect you to do.""

""But...yeah, we're good,"" he says. ""You're clearly genuine. Like, you're awkward as fuck, you know that?""

He takes a large bite out of a hamburger.

Dol|Helen

Helen really, truly does not understand people. So far as she could tell, going to the party was a ploy on the part of Ghetto G-sus in order to test her. Apparently he was concerned about being approached by spies, or some other such person.

She idly wonders who 'they' are, then bristles. ""I'm not 'awkward as fuck'!"" She snips at the hero, keeping her voice down so as to avoid further attention.

""I'm not a people person, sure, but I'll have you know that I'm very well coordinated! That's middling awkwardness at best.""

She takes another moment before continuing, ""Thank you for the apology, though. I was not prepared for anything social today.""

Teller|GM

The hamburger is gone before she's finished talking, along with half a piece of chicken. She's never seen anyone eat so quickly; it's vaguely horrifying.

""Middling?"" Ghetto G-sus laughs. ""Keep talking, you're just proving my point, baby.""

He finishes the piece of chicken, takes a sip from a can of coke, and starts in on a hotdog. ""Aight, Deep-Six. Shoot.""

Dol|Helen

Helen bristles a little further at the word 'baby', but stays strong. She's here for a reason, and she's almost achieved it.

Maybe she should pick up lunch for Ghetto G-sus at some point, though. He seemed to go through food fairly quickly, and it could be a nice gesture for her to make to a hero. Maybe a gift card, that way she doesn't have to go herself.

She takes a deep breath, setting aside her other thoughts and readying her questions.

""Alright,"" she says, ""You and he fought to a draw. How? I didn't think anyone had ever managed to even hurt the guy.""

Teller|GM

""They haven't,"" Ghetto G-sus says. ""But no one's managed to hurt me either, and my trick's better than his. Knock me down, I get right the fuck back up again.""

""Immovable object, unstoppable force. Draw."" He bumps two pieces of chicken together as a crude and unhelpful illustration, then eats them both.

Dol|Helen

Helen offers him a pained smile, feeling like she hadn't learned anything in that exchange.

""His 'trick'? I thought he just vanished whatever he touched,"" she asks, wiggling her fingers vaguely for emphasis

Teller|GM

""Yeah, that's his trick,"" he says. ""Mine is not dying.""

He sighs, sensing from the poorly masked pain in her smile that she's looking for more. ""His people tried to deal here, I kicked them out. Took them three asskickings to get the hint. Then Deep-Six shows up,"" he says. People around him get quieter, and he takes a gulp of his soda. ""This motherfucker just stands in the middle of the street, waiting for me. So what can I do? We fight. He's tryna get his hands on me, but I'm thinking 'um, fuck that', so I teleport, shoot, teleport, shoot.""

""Then he decides he's clever, and starts going after my people. Bullets are doing fuckall, and I can't just let him go around Deep-Sixing folks, so I get in his face.""

Ghetto G-sus' tone changes, sounding more flippant. ""He does his thing, sends me packing, but I don't stay gone. Freaks him the fuck out - he's not used to people bouncing back.""

""I tell him to fuck off, and he goes. And unlike me, he stays gone,"" he adds, with some satisfaction.

Dol|Helen

Huh. Helen's not really sure what to make of the story, other than that Deep-Six is apparently a coward. Why would he leave, though, if Ghetto G-Sus still couldn't touch him? Was he that badly unnerved?

""Why would you want to test me before telling me that, Ghetto G-sus?"" Helen asks, confused. The story hadn't seemed to include much beyond what she already knew, so why test?

Teller|GM

""Uh, what? Test you?"" Ghetto G-sus looks confused.

Dol|Helen

""Didn't you say that's what the party was about?"" Helen mirrors Ghetto G-sus's confusion.

Teller|GM

He laughs loudly, through a mouthful of hamburger. ""I wasn't testing you. I just wasn't trying to go anywhere with you to lunch. You could've been luring me away, or taking me to your leader, or something. Sounds crazy, but people've tried.""

""How the fuck would I have set this up so fast, anyway?""

Dol|Helen

""Oh."" Helen deflates a bit at the revelation that it had just been a convenient use of the bane of her existence. ""Sorry, like I said, people aren't really my thing. Well, they are, just not in a social way.""

""Anyways,"" she leaps back onto the topic, ""You say bullets didn't work on him. Did anything?""

Teller|GM

""Nah,"" Ghetto G-sus says. ""Dude was on some horror movie shit - just kept fucking coming.""

He grabs the foam football as it soars towards the table, catching it before it hits his plate.

""Hey, watch it,"" he warns, before throwing the ball back.

Dol|Helen

""Why'd he run away, then?"" Helen wonders aloud. It really did not make sense to her. Had he been growing tired?

She couldn't help but notice that Ghetto G-sus was being very careful with his food, and eating a lot of it.

Teller|GM

""'cuz he didn't want to be locked in eternal battle with G-sus?"" Ghetto G-sus says, with a shrug. The old woman looks at him with a frown, but doesn't say anything. ""He had to win, I just had to not lose.""

He leans back in his chair. ""Hey - why're you asking all of this, anyway? I know you're pissed off, and there've been rumors...just sayin', Deep-Six ain't a guy you wanna fuck with. Not one cape in the whole damn city, hero or villain, has been able to drop his ass.""

Dol|Helen

Helen gives a noncommittal shrug. ""I'd thought maybe there was some trick to his power and I might be able to figure out a way around it.""

She looks towards her own lap, where she's pantomiming dexterity exercises with her hands. ""I've got a lot of free time right now, thought it couldn't hurt.""

Teller|GM

""Look,"" Ghetto G-sus says kindly, finishing off the rest of his plate. ""You can't dwell on this bullshit, Hel. Gotta look forward, not back. Live.""

He vanishes, and for a moment she's not sure where to. Then she sees the foam football flying towards her.

Dol|Helen

Oh good God, this man was a maniac. Helen moves away from the football, trying to buy a moment to think. She makes an effort to catch the ball, hoping not to fall or make a spectacle.

Thinking back on it, she wasn't sure if she'd ever tried to catch a football.

Oh, this was not going to end well.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [4] = 4

    ROLL: ""Dex"" [3] +2 = 5

Teller|GM

To her mild surprise, she catches the football handedly. The small girl with the braids is the first to raise her arms, signalling for Helen to throw to her.

Dol|Helen

Helen attempts to throw the ellipsoid to the girl, despite her feeling utterly flabbergasted by this turn of events.

Was she playing catch? How did things come to this?

Teller|GM

The small girl catches the football. Ghetto G-sus playfully blocks the larger girl who tackled her last time, giving the small girl space to run screaming up the yard towards the fence, which is apparently the touchdown.

Ghetto G-sus walks back over to Helen, grinning. ""Aight, you don't have to stick around; I know this isn't your thing. Just don't let that motherfucker have killed two people, you know? Live your life.""

Dol|Helen

Helen gives Ghetto G-sus a look of concern, unhappy with his advice. What life did she really have to live? She couldn't work at the hospital, and the entire reason she had moved to Sicol Bend was no longer around.

All the same, she reaches into her pocket for a business card to offer to Ghetto G-sus.

""Here,"" she says as she holds it out, ""My contact info's on here. If you need a doctor, or want to take me up on that lunch, I'll be around.""

Teller|GM

He accepts the card, glances at it, then sticks it in the pocket of his tracksuit. ""Man, if I ever need a doctor, shit's really fucked. Lunch, though? I'm always down for that.""

Dol|Helen

""Never know,"" Helen replies with a shrug.

She stands up, getting ready to leave, politely. She wanted to get out of there, rather badly.

""Thank you for talking with me, Ghetto G-sus, and for the food, Eric,"" she says, nodding to each in turn.

Teller|GM

""Sure thing, Helen,"" Eric says, barely glancing up from his grill.

""Yeah, no problem,"" Ghetto G-sus says lightly. ""Catch you later...""

He trails off, frowning slightly as struck by a sudden realization. He goes to fishes her business card out of her pocket.

Dol|Helen

""Everything alright, Ghetto G-Sus?"" Helen asks the oddly acting cape, voice worried, if not for Ghetto G-sus. She really wanted to leave.

Teller|GM

He looks at the card, laughs, then frowns. ""Helen O. Troy - alright, that can't be your real name. What's up?""

Dol|Helen

""Damn it,"" Helen complains as she reaches up with a hand to rub at her temples.

""Alright, look, this is really simple. My family name is Willis, my husband's family name is Troy. He wanted me to take his name because he thought it would be funny.""

She waves her other hand in tired frustration at the business card.

""That's my actual name. Helen Ophelia Willis-Troy.""

God damn it, Owen.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [4] -1 = 3

Teller|GM

Ghetto G-sus looks unconvinced. ""It's fine, you don't have to bullshit me. I don't go around giving out my name either.""

""Catch you later, Helen O. Troy.""

Dol|Helen

""I'm not bullshitting you, it's my real name,"" Helen answers, too tired of the argument to feel argumentative about it.

With a practiced motion, she pulls out her license to show to Ghetto G-sus.

Teller|GM

""Uh-huh,"" Ghetto G-sus says skeptically, examining the license. ""This could be fake too.""

He hands it back to Helen. ""I ain't even mad, though. It makes sense.""

Dol|Helen

Helen increases the pressure on her temples. ""You know, I never had this problem when my husband could back me up.""

She puts her license away, then runs a hand through her bangs. ""You could just call me Helen Willis, if it makes you feel better. My name didn't even sound a little bit fake before the marriage.""

Teller|GM

""Why would she add the Willis if she just wanted to be Helen O. Troy?"" one of the men chimes in.

""That's to stop it from sounding fake, obviously,"" a woman argues.

""It still sounds pretty damn fake,"" Eric retorts. ""If she was going to use a fake name, she'd pick one that didn't sound fake. You know, it's like you said earlier, Double G - it's too awkward to not be genuine.""

""Unless that's what she wants us to think,"" one of the older kids ponders.

They all begin arguing about it. Ghetto G-sus speaks to Helen above the sudden din.

""Naw, if that somehow actually is your man's name, I ain't gonna disrespect it,"" he says. ""Helen Willis-Troy it is.""

Dol|Helen

""Thanks, Ghetto G-sus,"" Helen says, earnestly appreciative of his trust. ""I'm going to retreat now, but I really do appreciate you talking with me. I hope you have a good day.""

Teller|GM

He waves a farewell, then goes to make himself another plate of food, stepping deftly around the arguing cook to retrieve a trio of large hamburgers. The small girl who was the receiver to Helen's quarterback waves as well.

Dol|Helen

Helen waves at the girl, offering her a smile, then quickly retreats back to her car.

She hadn't learned any particularly interesting bits of information about Deep-Six, but Ghetto G-sus seemed nice enough.

Definitely not someone she would want to spend a lot of time with, given that he had dragged her into a party, but she could see his company being tolerable from time to time. That brief game of catch hadn't been bad either.

Even if raising a kid with Owen wasn't on the table anymore.

Ugh, she really needed a way to occupy her time that didn't make her think of him constantly.

Teller|GM

As she drives off, she can still faintly hear the people at the cookout debating whether her name is real.

    ROLL: ""Social - Presentation"" (1) [2] (2) +1 = 3

Teller|GM

As Johannes Burr finishes speaking, the individuals gathered inside the conference room applaud. He can tell the clapping is perfunctory, born of politeness and deference rather than appreciation. His speech hit all of the points he wanted it to, but he'd failed to set the tone he wanted. To inspire them.

The conference room is expansive, three times as long as it is wide. A map of the city hangs on one wall, and a large television screen is embedded in the wall behind him. There are no windows, and the door is heavy metal - in emergencies, the room is meant to double as a base of operations, his command center. A long table takes up most of the room. Burr stands at the head, and his employees line either side. Parahumans on the right, unpowereds on the left.

The head office wasn't exaggerating when they stressed the need to improve the Protectorate's image. Without exception, the outfits of the heroes are all dark and varying shades of offputting. Clearly designed by someone with an eye towards intimidation, rather than public appeal.

Sitting closest to Burr is Protectorate leader Oz. He's dressed in his heavy black robe, copper mace sitting casually to his side. It's hard to tell under his obfuscating costume, but of all the people in the room, he seems to be the only one that actually liked the speech.

Next is Purple Parrot, a pale woman in a suit and a bird mask, then Ampersand. The latter doesn't even make a show of paying attention, focusing instead on a repeatedly rubbing at a scratch on his armor.

Wan is dressed in an unflattering black bodysuit that displays his ample gut, and is wearing his collared cape almost like a blanket - he's half asleep. His minion, a horrible looking horned-demon-bat thing straight from the depths of hell, sits on his shoulder. In sharp contrast to its master, the bat stared at Burr disconcertingly the entire time.

Farther down are the Wards, Finial and Playpen. Finial's sits upright in his chair, expression hidden behind his large silver mask. Playpen wears black makeup smeared around her eyes, a black choker necklace, and a dress that billows outwards every time she moves her legs (which is often). She fidgeted in her seat throughout the meeting, kicking her feet against the table in defiance of Finial's hissed rebukes.

To his left, Deputy Director Kendrick. The seat next to him is empty, but it's where PR Director Gareau should have been. Beyond that, liaisons Hamasaki and Adams, then squad leaders Beck, Hamilton, and Song. All professionally attentive.

Aside from Gareau and the two new parahumans he'd be bringing onboard later this week, these dozen individuals were the core of his organization. All of his assets, everyone he had available to work with, to prevent this city from tearing itself apart.

Bel|Burr

Johannes is struck by how familiar the sensation is. Seems like, be it parahuman or mere mortal, police work is dirty business.

""...and this city,"" he finishes. ""Unless anyone has any questions, I'd like for the Deputy Director and liaisons,"" motioning down that side of the table, ""to stay after for a moment, but the rest of y'all are dismissed."" He half-takes his seat, then rises again, remembering something.

""Oh, I'll be coming around to have talks with a few of you, so don't wander too far!"" That said, he sits again and waits for the rest of the staff to file out.

Teller|GM

The squad leaders and heroes, save for Playpen, rise from their seats and begin filing out of the room.

""Playpen,"" Oz says commandingly. The girl reluctantly hops out of her seat and shuffles after them, scraping her shoes on the ground dramatically.

Now it's just Kendrick, Hamasaki, and Adams. The three of them look to the Director.

""Good speech, sir,"" Adams says. ""And once again, welcome to Sicol Bend.""

Bel|Burr

He waves his hand dismissively. ""I try, but it's standard fare. And thank you, all, for the welcome."" He shifts in his chair, then leans back and crosses his arms over his chest. ""Now then, I may be Director but you three got us this far. I wouldn't mind hearing your opinions on where we are, starting with you, Adams.""

Teller|GM

Adams very carefully doesn't look at Hamasaki and Kendrick before talking. ""I focus mainly on the team dynamics. They're not bad, but they could be better. Will need to be better, to deal with what's coming. The heroes are doing fine, in their own ways. Some of the squad leaders are overworked, and the two Wards don't get along.""

""We've been looking outward for a while,"" Adams admits. ""Taking care of the city instead of taking care of ourselves. I think we have a good opportunity to change that, here.""

Bel|Burr

Burr grunts noncommittally. ""Makes sense. Now is a good time for that."" He turns. ""Hamasaki?""

Teller|GM

""Our relationship with outside parties...has a lot of room for improvement,"" Hamasaki says, tactfully. ""That goes hand in hand with PR. If Gareau was here, I think she would say we need to take drastic and immediate steps in that department.""

Bel|Burr

""Don't be tactful with me, ma'am, if I'm going to help here I need the full picture. I'll be seeing Gareau after this, but where exactly do you think we're going wrong?""

Teller|GM

She hesitates. ""One of the biggest issues we're facing in my department is with the Brotherhood.""

""They're more ingrained in the city than the other gangs. The Sicol Tong has a lot of influence over the docks, but the Brotherhood has someone almost everywhere. Someone they're blackmailing, or who they bribe, or even someone who's one of theirs.""

She sighs. ""When I reach out to local government agencies, I'm never fully sure if the person I'm speaking to is in their pocket or not.""

Bel|Burr

""And how do you propose we deal with it? We can't very well just sic capes on government employees, can we?""

Teller|GM

""That's the issue, isn't it?"" Hamasaki says softly. ""I would recommend cutting the Brotherhood off at the head and burning the stump, but that's easier said than done.""

Bel|Burr

Burr nods understandingly before turning to his predecessor.

""Kendrick, you've handled this post expertly 'til now. What are you thinking about this whole situation?""

Teller|GM

Kendrick drums his finger on the table. ""Until now, we were dealing with a united, singular organism. Nobody to compete with for territory, no natural predators. Now we're dealing with three, and they're all going to be at each other’s throats.""

""My advice? Let them fight. Play referee, make sure they don't do too much damage or kill too many people. Let things carry on - hell, stir the pot if you have to - until any particularly problematic individuals are locked up or otherwise out of the picture.""

""Then crack down, push things to a normal level and keep them there. You were a police officer - you know this isn't a war we win, just one we try not to lose.""

He looks at Burr curiously, trying to see how he's taking it.

Bel|Burr

""You're absolutely right. Play firefighter, rather than general."" He takes a sip of the thermos of tea on the table.

""Hamasaki, Adams, thank you so very much for your input. I'll be along later to check on department particulars, but for now that should do it. Kendrick, a brief word?""

Teller|GM

""Of course,"" Kendrick says.

""Have a good night, Director,"" Adams says, with a nod towards him. Hamasaki is silent as the pair rise and exit the room.

Bel|Burr

Burr nods to the pair of them and waits for the door to click closed behind them.

Interdepartmental tensions? There's some in every department on this green earth, but it's important to decipher early. Burr resolutely does not think about Everett.

""Deputy Director Kendrick. We both know why we're in this...situation. I wanted to let you know that I understand that you were not moved for any reason related to your capabilities, and I don't plan on treating you as such. Felt that was an important part of this here transition."" He thinks about taking another sip of the tea but does not.

""That said, what do you think is important, going forward?""

Teller|GM

""I knew what might happen,"" Kendrick says calmly. ""And you're not the man who took my job, just the one it was given to by the people who did. But thank you for saying that.""

""Going forward, don't be too quick to abandon what's been working so far,"" he says quietly. ""You'll be getting a lot of pressure from the higher ups, from Gareau, from the capes themselves.""

""It's a matter of being good versus looking good,"" he stresses. ""Don't completely abandon the first in pursuit of the second. It's dangerous out there, and nothing's worse for PR than scraping dead heroes off the street.""

Bel|Burr

""I understand. And I'll keep that in mind."" Burr levers himself out of his chair with a grunt and extends a hand. ""Now then, there's an office to run, and at least nine people expecting a Director to come knocking."" He smiles. ""Wouldn't do to keep them waiting on the first day.""

Teller|GM

""Sure wouldn't,"" Kendrick says, shaking his hand. He squints at him, as if weighing something, then his normal expression returns. ""And Burr, you ever need to do something the higher ups would...frown upon, feel free to blame me for it. So long as it's important, I don't mind being the bad guy.""

Bel|Burr

""I appreciate that, I really do."" He picks up the tea thermos and tosses it to his other hand. ""Hopefully I'll never need it.""

Burr makes his way through the maze of chairs inevitably left after any meeting and begins to head towards the PRT squad barracks.

Teller|GM

The squad members are scattered around the room when Burr arrives. The aesthetic is less 'barracks' and more 'breakroom'. Song is making himself a cup of coffee, Beck is talking with two other PRT officers, and Hamilton is sitting at a table reading a pamphlet. All heads turn to look at him as he enters.

Bel|Burr

He gives a little wave to all, staying in the doorway. Wouldn't do to intrude in their space just yet.

""Sorry to interrupt. Beck, Hamilton, Song, a brief word?"" He motions toward the hallway, ready to take a walk.

Teller|GM

""Sure, Director,"" Song says. Beck and Hamilton follow immediately, while Song takes a few long seconds to finish making his coffee. All three step out into the hallway.

Bel|Burr

Burr starts slowly making his way down the hallway, more to keep his legs moving than anything else.

Genially, he asks, ""How many hours a week would you say you three work?"" Interesting, to see who speaks up in a group.

Teller|GM

""Maybe fifty? Sixty some weeks,"" Beck says, looking at the other two. Song nods.

Bel|Burr

Not surprising. On both counts. ""And your squads?""

Teller|GM

""Closer to forty, forty-five. Not too much lower than us, but we make sure they rotate out, get some downtime,"" Beck says easily. He sounds more comfortable than he did earlier in the day, when he had just met the new Director.

Bel|Burr

""Mhm. Well, we'll be working on rotating you three out, getting you some downtime. We have the personnel for it, no sense working you to death when it's not needed.""

He strolls on a bit further, taking a sip from his thermos and waving to a passing bureaucrat. ""How do you feel about your places in the spotlight?""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [4] +1 = 5

Teller|GM

""That'd be appreciated,"" Song says. Burr spots the older man give Beck a look, and the two of them fall silent.

After a few moments, Hamilton speaks up. Her voice is curt, professional. ""I'd prefer not to be in the spotlight if possible, Director, but I understand if this is required.""

Bel|Burr

Burr chuckles. ""Well, thankfully then, it won't be for much longer. The main reason for my stopping by is that I wanted to talk with you all about a, well, a 'limelight sharing program'. Pair a Protectorate cape up with you long-term, let the public see the two of you as synonymous, then ease off until they can stand as a group, with you three taking some needed time off.""

He lets the concept float, looking for their initial responses.

Teller|GM

""Makes sense,"" Beck says, nodding. Song nods as well, but it looks like it's more of a response to Beck nodding than what Burr said.

""Did you have specific heroes in mind for us?"" Hamilton asks. She sounds cautiously hopeful.

Bel|Burr

""That's the point I wanted to leave you with! I have plenty of documentation, but since I've been on site for all of,"" he checks his watch, ""three hours, I assumed you would know who you work with best. Have first and second picks, from the Protectorate only, mind you, on my desk by tomorrow morning, and we'll see if we can't get some training in together before you hit the streets together.""

He smiles before checking his watch again. Already three hours on site? So much to do and so little time...

Teller|GM

""Sure thing,"" Song says. He takes a long draw from his coffee. ""We've all got a good idea who we want, guys?""

""Yeah,"" Beck says, as Hamilton nods. ""A pretty good idea.""

""We'll talk it over and get that list to you,"" Song says.

Bel|Burr

He nods, enjoying the play of sunlight across his face and the movement of the waves as the group passes a window.

""Is there anything you want to ask me? Any requests just sitting there, concepts you've been playing with? Gimme something to say no to."" He belies this last statement with a knowing smile.

Teller|GM

""The training equipment could use updating,"" Hamilton says, the first to speak up for once. ""A larger department budget for external instructors would also be welcome.""

""Training equipment?"" Beck laughs. ""Our field equipment could do with some updating. Us leaders get the nice stuff, but Kendrick wouldn't shell out for new equipments for our squads.""

Song just takes another large sip of coffee.

Bel|Burr

""Done and done. I'll talk to the boys in accounting, see what we can do. Don't expect any miracles tomorrow, but I'll let you know."" He sips his thermos. ""If that's all?""

Teller|GM

Song lowers his coffee as the Director begins taking a sip of his, and smiles to himself like he just thought of something funny. ""That's all I've got if that's all you got, Director.""

""Thank you, Director Burr. Sir,"" Hamilton says. Beck simply nods and makes a noise of agreement.

Bel|Burr

""Then I'll see you around. Now, I should head over, see how the other side is doing. If you'll excuse me?""

Teller|GM

The group separates, and Burr walks off in search of his Protectorate heroes. The hallways are nice, if a little cramped and outdated: wood-paneled, and thick windows looking out over the sea every few feet.

Bel|Burr

Burr makes a note to look into the interior decorating budget, not to mention the overall budget. Playing nice with committees is his specialty.

Teller|GM

Oz and Purple Parrot will either be in the heroes common area or their personal quarters. Given that he's asked them not to go too far, the common area is a better bet.

When he arrives, he finds all of the capes there, sans Ampersand. It's noisy - not in a bad way - until he starts opening the door, and then it falls completely silent.

""Hello, Director,"" Oz says, tapping his mace and cutting off the pink light it's emitting. Playpen, who was sitting nearby staring at it, blinks a few times and then looks over at Burr with narrowed eyes.

Bel|Burr

""Hm. Oz, Purple Parrot? If you have a minute?""

Teller|GM

Wan mutters something. Purple Parrot gives him a sharp look, then she and Oz follow Burr into the hallway.

Bel|Burr

Burr makes a mental note to have a talk with Wan, then starts moving down the hallway, assuming they'll find their places.

Pensively, as if tossing out a casual observation about the weather, he says, ""So. What was that, I wonder?""

Teller|GM

Oz and Purple Parrot fall into step besides him, Oz on his right, Purple Parrot on is left. Oz's robe swishes with each step.

""What was what?"" Purple Parrot asks. ""There are a lot of 'that's around here, unfortunately.""

Bel|Burr

""The conversation, mostly. Just trying to get a feel for the group dynamic around here, I wanted your two's perspective."" Interesting.

Teller|GM

""Oh, that,"" Purple Parrot says. ""Nothing, really. A lot of speculating about who our new team members would be.""

""You're still getting a feel for things around here, so I'm guessing you haven't decided yet,"" Oz says sagely. ""Try telling that to them, though.""

Bel|Burr

""Mhm,"" he says noncommittally, ""Ms. Parrot, I wanted to let you know, I was hoping to work you in with the PRT squads, get you some extra training time with some new instructors coming in. Any particular preferences?""

Teller|GM

""Ms. Parrot? It's Purple Parrot or Reagan, if that's alright,"" Purple Parrot says, sounding amused. ""For squad leaders to work with? I'd pick Hamilton, if I'm able. She's got a good build for my power to copy from, and we work well together.""

Bel|Burr

""Understandable, for sure. Any skills you've been hankerin' to get a shot at? There's some extra PRT training coming up, I can arrange for you to be in the room if you'd like.""

Teller|GM

""Hm,"" Purple Parrot muses, think for a second. Her gait slows, and he notices that her footsteps have become perfectly synced with his own. ""If it's training meant for the PRT, I don't know whether the skills I'm looking for would overlap with the skills they need. Acrobatics, martial artists...it might work out better if I continue studying those individually.""

Bel|Burr

""Of course."" He intentionally slows his steps slightly as a personal experiment. ""If you wouldn't mind, I'd like a word with Oz?""

Teller|GM

""Of course,"" Purple Parrot says. Her gait doesn't shift along with his as she turns around, heading back to the common area. Oz continues on, silent and inscrutable beneath his robes.

Bel|Burr

Burr stops in front of a window. ""So. What was that?""

Teller|GM

""Director?"" Oz says, making the title a question. He comes to a stop next to him.

Bel|Burr

Burr sighs. ""I walk in on a room where a room filled with people suddenly falls silent, it's not usually just office talk. What was it?""

Why don't they talk about that light? He makes a mental note to talk with Ampersand about it.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [2] +1 = 3

Teller|GM

""Er...that is what we were talking about,"" Oz says, then attempts a joke. ""Trust me, nobody's plotting mutiny. But we don't know you very well yet, so...think of the silence as a respect thing. People giving you their attention.""

""Give it some time. We'll all get comfortable, and then you'll have a hard time getting anyone around here to listen to you,"" he finishes, still using the lighthearted tone.

Bel|Burr

He chuckles. ""Fair enough. How about you, then, any squad preferences?""

Teller|GM

""Song knows what he's doing, but I'm easy to please,"" he says. ""If Hamilton and Purple Parrot are going to be paired, I'll be fine with either of the other two.""

Bel|Burr

""Not necessarily, but I'll keep it in mind. Any particular requests as far as gear goes, material requisition?""

Teller|GM

Oh dear, he's set him off. Oz talks for the next eight minutes about materials and parts he could use, for his personal gear as well as the HQ - and that's despite the sense Burr gets that he's trying to exercise restraint.

""...and that's the long and short of it,"" he finishes. ""Sorry, I'm talking your ear off. I can put it all in a formal request form, get it on your desk sometime this week.""

Bel|Burr

""That...would probably be best,"" he says, blinking. ""I suppose I'll talk to you later, then? Rounds to make, and such.""

Teller|GM

""Of course,"" Oz says, offering his hand. ""If there's ever anything you need, don't hesitate to ask. I maintain a lot of tech around the base, and I can install whatever lighting you want. Deputy Director Kendrick should have a list.""

Bel|Burr

Burr shakes it firmly. ""I'll double check, but I'll let you know if I need anything. Until then.""

Teller|GM

Oz walks off, and Burr is left alone in the hallway, still looking out of the window. This one faces south, and provides him with an impressive view of Sicol Bend. Buildings, cars, people...all of the little moving components of the city. Everything and everyone that he's now responsible for, in a small and large way.

He heads towards his office.

"
"Teller|GM

The northeastern most part of Sicol Bend is more upscale than the rest of the city, but the transition is subtle. The roads slowly become wider and better paved, the sidewalks cleaner, and the buildings start being made of stone more often than brick. A handful of buildings have stylized steps, or fancy, unpronounceable names on their signs, but by and large the aesthetic is a subdued and tastefully restrained one.

The Brotherhood's estate, in contrast, does away with the concept of subtlety altogether. It consists of at least 3 acres of well-kept green, separated from the street by a tall stone wall. Two angel statues guard either side of the wrought iron gate, hands resting on downward facing swords, expressions stony and judgmental.

At the top of a long driveway sits the manor itself, 3 stories tall and twice as wide. It's a stout, old fashioned looking building. Pillars frame the doorway, and balconies emerge from several points on the second story. There's even a large brick chimney.

Schuyler's car slows, and then come to a stop at the gate. Pas de Deux is with him - Pas in the passenger seat and Deux lounging in the back, costumes on, thin silver chain dangling between them.

""Ready?"" Pas asks simply. There's a hint of uneasiness in her voice.

Antioch|Schuyler

""Yeah, I'm ready."" Schuyler's uneasy as well, but there's no hint of it in his tone or demeanor.

He can't help but think of the Brotherhood's manor as one of the swankier frat houses he's seen in college, and lets himself grin slightly.

""Don't worry, we got this.""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [3] +1 = 4

Teller|GM

""Mhm,"" Deux chimes up.

""Behave,"" Pas warns, in her sternest voice.

Outside of the car, an intercom buzzes to life. ""What's your business here?""

Antioch|Schuyler

""Hey there - it's Nathaniel Schuyler. Manager of the Keepers - I contacted Shakesphere by PHO?""

Teller|GM

A pause of three - four - five seconds, then the intercom buzzes again, ""They're expecting you.""

The intercom clicks off without another word, and the gate swings open. The driveway stretches forward ahead of them.

Antioch|Schuyler

He pulls slowly down the driveway after the gate opens, looking for a place to park.

""Man,"" he clucks, ""these guys are loaded. Where's my goddamn valet?""

Teller|GM

Pas de Deux doesn't say anything. Normally she'd respond with a quip - maybe she's taking this seriously, or trying to get in character.

The driveway widens as it approaches the manor, becoming large enough to accommodate 3 cars side by side; more than enough room to park in. There's a garage attached to the manor, but the door is shut and clearly not for visitors.

Antioch|Schuyler

After parking, Schuyler gets out of the car, opening the doors for Pas de Deux, and the three of them walk up to the imposing double doors. He raps sharply, twice, announcing his presence.

Teller|GM

Pas de Deux stands on both sides of him, a few feet back. He's not a short man, but they have several inches on him. They look poised, but tense. Ready for any trouble.

The door swings open immediately after he finishes knocking. A skinny man in a black suit stands before him, brown hair slicked back. He looks sharp, but he smells slightly off, like someone who came back from the gym and put on cologne instead of showering.

""Mr. Schuyler,"" he says, looking first at Pas de Deux, then to Nathaniel. ""Please, come inside.""

He takes them through a coatroom, and then takes an immediate left and leads them down a short hallway. ""Seachange will be with you shortly. Can I get you something to drink? Eat?""

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler presents the wine bottle he's been carrying neck-first to the man. ""A bucket of ice for this, perhaps?""

""Otherwise,"" he says, glancing left, then right at Pas de Deux, ""I think we're fine.""

Teller|GM

""Sure thing,"" he says. He pushes open a heavy oak door, revealing a large conference room. A large oak table sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by several chairs, and a 50' flatscreen TV hangs on the wall. The lighting is yellow and soft.

""Make yourself comfortable,"" the man says, holding the door open for them. ""I'll go get your ice.""

Antioch|Schuyler

He thanks the man as he crosses the door's threshold, soaking in the room's furnishing - the wood, its varnish, the lining of the chairs.

Schuyler pulls out several chairs, both for himself and Pas de Deux, and allows himself to sink comfortably into one of the seats.

Teller|GM

Pas sits down next to him, while Deux begins to walk around the room, running a hand over the wall. A sharp jerk on the chain brings her back over to them.

""What?"" Deux demands.

""Sit down.""

As she settles into her seat, the door swings open. In walks, not the smelly man or Seachange, but a woman who can only be Allele.

She's a large blonde woman, stocky and more than a few pounds overweight. She's dressed in a white lab coat over a pair of dark red scrubs, black sneakers, and thin black gloves. Her mouth and nose are covered by what appears to be a custom surgical mask; a thick red cloth held in place by black leather straps. A pair of black-rimmed glasses rest snugly on her nose.

""Hi,"" she says. Her gaze lingers on Pas de Deux. ""Keepers, right? Nice name.""

She pulls up a seat across from them, resting her elbows on the table and her chin in her palms.

Antioch|Schuyler

""Thanks,"" he responds, extending a hand towards her for a firm handshake. ""Nathaniel Schuyler - a pleasure to meet you. Next to me, of course, the capes Pas de Deux, formerly of Paramount.""

Teller|GM

She shakes Nathaniel's hand, and then holds out a hand to Deux. She stares at it unblinkingly.

""I don't bite,"" Allele says encouragingly, and then smiles to herself. ""Well, won't.""

After another few seconds of inaction, Allele makes a small noise in her throat, then lowers her hand and sits back down. ""What brings you to our lair?""

Antioch|Schuyler

""Sorry, Pas isn't exactly what I'd call a social creature sometimes,"" Schuyler says apologetically.

""Well, as you already know, I'm attempting to get an independent cape team called the Keepers off the ground, and I was looking to purchase a headquarters.""

""Since the headquarters I have an eye on happen to be in your territory,"" he continues, ""I'd like to talk things out with you beforehand, so you can know more about what that entails.""

Teller|GM

She drums her fingers on the table, then grunts. ""Seachange doesn't like the idea, but I'm sure we can work something out. It'd be nice to have more capes around the area.""

Just then the door swings open again, and in walks Seachange. He's a man of average height and build. His hands and feet are pale and bare, but every other inch of his body is covered by his costume, what looks to be a modified wetsuit. Large pockets are attached to the legs, and a red belt hangs loosely at his waist. In addition to a long loop of thin black rope, a sheathed knife, and a holstered gun, pouches of various sizes dangle from the belt.

His face is completely covered by the material of the wetsuit, and the outline of his mouth and nose are clearly visible, raising the question of how (or if) he breathes. A pair of red-tinted goggles cover his eyes.

He places a bucket of ice onto the table with an unceremonious clatter. ""Hi. Seachange.""

He shakes Nathaniel's hand, and his grip is firm. Then he takes his seat at the head of the table, looking out of place in his costume, but still exuding confidence. This is clearly his house, his room.

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler hollows out a bit of the ice, stashing the bottle of wine within.

""Hi, Nathaniel Schuyler,"" he replies, by way of simple greeting. He can cede the floor to Seachange, let the cape take control of the situation on his home turf, dictate where the conversation goes.

Teller|GM

""So,"" Seachange says heavily. He lets the word hang by itself in the air for a moment before continuing. Allele watches silently, giving him her full attention. ""You're looking to buy property in Marimer, and came to ask...what? My permission, to establish the HQ of your hero group a stone's throw from here?""

""Correct me if I'm wrong, of course,"" he adds.

Antioch|Schuyler

""More or less. It'd be stupid of me to assume that I could waltz on in and buy a nice property in Marimer without at least meeting with you first, not to mention extremely rude.""

""Of course, having the headquarters of a hero group in your territory would be concerning to you, but that's another reason why I'm here - to address those concerns, and give you a clearer idea about my intentions.""

Teller|GM

""Go on,"" Seachange encourages. His voice isn't muffled at all by the full face mask, and it grants him an impossible to penetrate poker face.

Antioch|Schuyler

""I'm here, first and foremost, to prove myself. You might know about my departure from Paramount, a successful corporate hero team, and Pas de Deux's as well,"" he says, pausing to gesture at the two capes.

""Well, I'm hoping to apply my methodologies for the management of administration of an independent hero team here in town - and the only way I'm going to be able to get ahead is by focusing on soft targets.""

""The Brotherhood,"" he continues, gesturing at the well-furnished room around him, ""very much so doesn't fit that criteria. I came into town with that expectation - my reception here has only further solidified that idea.""

""There are going to be capes, independent capes, appearing in the city from in-town and out, catalyzed by the power vacuum Deep-Six's absence has created. Chaotic elements, each one nudging the city further from its status quo.""

""The Brotherhood's practically an institution of Sicol Bend, so I'm sure you realize the balancing act necessary to keep the city in order - in equilibrium, rather.""

""That's the first part of it, at least - stop me if I'm going too fast.""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [3] +1 = 4

Teller|GM

Seachange mulls over his words. ""If you came to Sicol Bend looking for soft targets, you might've come to the wrong city, friend. But go on, I'm following you so far.""

Antioch|Schuyler

""You'll also note that the Protectorate has been reconfigured - by Kendricks, I believe? - to a team composition best suited for operating without direct confrontation, a legacy of Deep-Six's presence.""

""With that in mind, I'm looking to supplement them."" He pauses, smiling slightly.

""Perhaps supplant them is a better word, if I'm to be completely honest.""

Teller|GM

Seachange draws in a deep breath, and then lets it out. ""You've got a pair, I'll give you that. Problem is, I have a hard time seeing how things are going to be copacetic between us.""

""You say you're here to supplant the Protectorate. Prove yourself - I know what that's like, and I know you're not going to settle for scraps. You don't make a name for yourself beating on smallfries...sure as hell not a name big enough to edge out the Protectorate.""

""Maybe the Keepers and the Brotherhood would get along for a little bit, but the bigger you get, the more cramped this city's going to feel with the both of us in it. One day, you're going to get it into your head to do something big and heroic to cement your reputation, like take down one of the big three.""

""That's assuming you even make it that far. But why should I help you along? Why even allow you to get started at all?"" he asks, a threatening note in his voice.

Antioch|Schuyler

""Well, for starters,"" Schuyler says, deflecting Seachange's aggressive tone with a grin that shows teeth, ""you wouldn't be one of the big three that I’d go after, when it comes to it.""

Teller|GM

""Cross your heart?"" Allele asks sarcastically.

""Hope to die?"" Deux chimes in suddenly, looking at Allele intensely. A slight rattle behind Schuyler signals the yanking of a chain.

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler raises his right hand, flat-palmed. ""Scout's honor,"" he says, still grinning.

    ROLL: ""Presentation - Trustworthiness"" [3] (1) (2) +1 = 4

Teller|GM

Seachange doesn't sound amused at all. ""Your word might hold more weight, if we knew each other for longer than the span of ten minutes.""

""But I'm willing to give you a chance. You're smart to want to settle down in Marimer. If you want to make a name for yourself, you're going to need time, a safe place. Friends nearby.""

""And I do think we could be friends, as long as you're going after the Wolves and the Tigers. We won't get in your way - no, even better. We'll support you.""

He smiles beneath his mask. ""You can have your HQ, and we'd donate, say, 200K a year to help bolster a new group of upstanding heroes?""

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler does his best to quash the reaction, raising an eyebrow in a response.

""That's one way to ensure my loyalty,"" he replies, surprise in his tone carefully modulated.

""You touched upon another reason I wanted Marimer, actually,"" Schuyler continues. ""Wolves, Tigers, Whirlwhind - all in arm's reach.""

Teller|GM

Seachange makes a clucking noise at the mention of the final gang. ""Whirlwind. Those are smallfries I'd be happy to see put down.""

""So, what do you think of my offer?""

Antioch|Schuyler

""It sounds damn good, Seachange. Just so happens I was focusing on stamping out Whirlwind as my first big play in Sicol, actually. They're small enough that it's feasible, but aggravating enough to where if we take them down, people can't help but notice us.""

As he speaks, Schuyler sticks his hand out to the Brotherhood boss, ready to seal the deal.

Teller|GM

""Excellent,"" Seachange says. The table is large enough that both men have to stand and move over to each other before shaking hands. ""I've never minded having heroes around. Keeps away the riffraff.""

Allele looks pleased. She clears her throat, and then speaks up. ""While you're here, I would love to get a tissue sample from Pas de Deux.""

Antioch|Schuyler

""Ah, that's right,"" Schuyler says. ""You're the geneticist Tinker, aren't you?""

He looks to the two. ""Pas, it's your call, of course.""

Teller|GM

Pas de Deux turns both heads towards him, and then Pas looks at Allele. ""...Okay.""

A beat later, Deux unexpectedly shakes her head. ""No.""

She pulls her counterpart to her, wrapping an arm around her protectively. ""No. Sorry. No.""

It's likely that only Schuyler is close enough to see the brief flicker of surprise on Pas's face. ""Okay, no, then.""

Allele looks extremely disappointed.

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler shrugs, looking apologetic. ""Will a tissue sample of mine be worth much?"" he offers jokingly, in an attempt to lighten the mood. ""All I can offer are my rugged good looks.""

Teller|GM

Allele looks him up and down appraisingly. Completely serious, she nods, and says, ""A little skinny, but you've got good genes otherwise. Give me your arm.""

She pulls out a small kit from her coat, and he sees a scalpel, a plastic bag, some cotton balls, and two bottles of liquid.

Pas de Deux looks on in concern.

Antioch|Schuyler

Whoops. He was joking, but doesn't want to look like an ass now. He swallows his nerves and sticks out his left arm for Allele.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [5] = 5

Teller|GM

Seachange watches, seeming just as concerned as Schuyler feels. Allele cleans a disconcertingly large area of his arm with a cotton ball and alcohol, along with her hands and the scalpel. She then applies a thicker liquid from the second bottle to his arm - it burns at first, and then it just feels numb.

    ROLL: ""Allele's Dexterity"" [5] = 5

She works swiftly and neatly, removing what feels like a significant portion of flesh from his arm. It's a long shallow strip, a half-inch across and several inches down the length of his arm. He can still feel some pain, but he bears it admirably.

Minutes later, his arm is wrapped in bandages, and a some of his bloody flesh is sitting in a plastic ziploc bag. She seals it and places it into a pocket, looking happy.

""See?"" she says, looking at Pas de Deux. ""Simple. Sure you won't-""

Pas de Deux shakes their heads in unison.

Antioch|Schuyler

Eager to draw attention away from his reticent pair of capes, Schuyler cracks, ""Hey, do you know the approximate healing time for this?""

He points at the bandaged arm with his right hand's thumb, continuing, ""That's my paperwork-holding arm.""

""A few weeks,"" Seachange says, also sounding eager to change the subject. ""Damn, Schuyler. When you're in, you're in, huh? Use some cocoa butter to keep the scarring down.""

""It'll start hurting soon,"" he says, lifting the wine bottle from the ice bucket. ""You'll want to have some of this inside you when it does.""

Antioch|Schuyler

""Got some glasses we can use? I think this is a pretty decent opportunity for a toast.""

Internally, he winces at the healing time, and makes a mental note about the cocoa butter, metaphorically circling it in red pen several times. He really doesn't want scars.

Teller|GM

Seachange distributes glasses, and pours them all hearty servings of wine. ""To the future, and Schuyler's arm.""

Antioch|Schuyler

Schuyler can't help but laugh at that. He distributes glasses to Pas de Deux, then takes a long pull.

""To the future,"" he echoes.

"Teller|GM

""...Burr, and two new heroes. What do you think, TF? Think the PRT will turn it around?""

""Hard to tell, this early on. I hope a new Director signals big, positive changes...but I'm not holding my breath.""

""Wise. Some people haven't inhaled in six years, the poor bastards.""

Schuyler sits in his hotel room, the Radio Free Sicol website pulled up in front of him on his laptop. There are no visuals, other than a plain 'broadcasting' animation in the center of the page, and a icon in the corner indicating that the show is currently live. A light chiming tone suddenly sounds in the background.

""Ah, that's our cue. Onto TF's favorite part of the show...""

""Oh, hell.""

""Call-ins! You all know the drill. Give us a call, or I'm just going to end up talking to TF about dumb shit for the next 20 minutes.""

Anti|Schuyler

Schuyler, on-cue, picks up his cell phone and dials the number of Radio Free Sicol.

Teller|GM

It rings once, twice before being picked up. ""RFS. Passphrase?""

Anti|Schuyler

He tabs over to the private message to Broadcast, rattling off the alphanumerical sequence listed within.

Teller|GM

""Oh, Schuyler. Hey,"" Trigger Finger greets him, sounding a fair bit friendlier after he finishes. ""Thought it was going to be Rinaldi again.""

""I'm going to put you on in a second, after Broadcast finishes whatever it is he's talking about."" His breakfast, it sounds like. ""Know what you want to say?""

Anti|Schuyler

""Yep. I'm ready to go.""

Teller|GM

""Good luck. You're live after the beep,"" she says, and then the line goes silent.

""We've got our first caller,"" she says, once again on the air. ""Here to spare us from the details of Broadcast's banana pancakes is Nathaniel Schuyler, big boss of a new hero team, the Keepers.""

""Hi, Nate,"" Broadcast says. ""First off, welcome to Sicol Bend. Second, do you like banana pancakes?""

Beep.

Anti|Schuyler

""Thanks for the welcome, Broadcast. I haven't been here long, but every welcome I've gotten has been pretty warm.""

""More of a waffle guy myself, if I'm to be perfectly honest - more syrup.""

Teller|GM

""I respect your honesty, but detest your breakfast choices,"" Broadcast says. ""Okay, but seriously, what brings you to Sicol Bend? We've got a nice view of the ocean, but that's pretty much negated by the brewing gang warfare.""

Anti|Schuyler

""The brewing gang warfare, actually,"" Schuyler responds, a cheeky tone to his voice.

""I'm a former employee of Paramount, the corporate hero team - and I've struck off on my own to try and get an independent cape team set up here in town.""

    ROLL: ""Social - Presentation"" (3) [5] (4) +2 = 7

Teller|GM

""And how's that going for you?"" Trigger Finger asks. ""I hear you brought Pas de Deux with you. Anyone else on board, yet?""

""Wait, hold up, TF. I want to know why he left Paramount.""

Anti|Schuyler

""We disagreed on how to manage capes. They've been downsizing a lot, lately, culling everything but the cream of the crop - taking cues from Eminent, competing between teammates and basically making teamwork and interpersonal relationships between members of the same organization fall to pieces.""

""That's why I'm trying this thing on my own, partially.""

Teller|GM

""Speaking of competition, you said something about picking up the PRT's slack in your first message to us. Do you disagree with them on how to manage capes too?""

Anti|Schuyler

""Not quite - moreso that they're still very much geared towards dealing with Deep-Six, and it's gonna take some time for them to shift gears.""

Teller|GM

""Diplomatic answer,"" Broadcast says, a note of fake disappointment in his voice.

""Anyway, back to my question,"" Trigger Finger cuts in. ""How's the team building going?""

Anti|Schuyler

""That's why I'm here calling in,"" Schuyler smoothly responds. ""Pas de Deux came down with me, so I've got a tag-team on board, but I'm looking for more folks to join up.""

He pauses, then adds, half-jokingly, ""We have a website.""

Teller|GM

""TheKeepers.com, right?"" Broadcasts says. ""Seriously, guys, he's got a website, like some sort of professional.""

""Oh, and hey, while we're on the subject...what is their deal? Pas de Deux, I mean. For our listeners who probably don't know them, they're two ladies in identical outfits chained together. You'll be seeing them around the city soon, probably.""

""So yeah...a power thing? Just really into each other?""

Anti|Schuyler

""The chain is strictly for the sick clothesline maneuver for their takedowns,"" Nathaniel jokes.

""Nah, it's a power thing. Best not to give it away, since they might be using it to kick some ass in the next few days.""

Teller|GM

""I figured you'd say that, but I had to ask. And now TF is glaring at me, because she knows I'm just going to keep assuming they're really into each other.""

""Ow! And now she's hitting me. Domestic violence, tsk.""

There's a brief scuffle, and then Trigger Finger speaks again. ""If someone asked why they should join your hero group, what would you tell them?""

Anti|Schuyler

""Ooh, that's a good one,"" Schuyler says, pausing to mull for a few moments.

""Do you want to make a difference? Do you want to be a part of something bigger and better?""

""I do, too. Let's do it together.""

Maybe a little too cheesy on the last bit, Schuyler thinks, but not terrible.

Teller|GM

""That was cheesy as hell, man, but okay,"" Broadcast says. ""Maybe we could use some cheesy around this city.""

""Okay, last thing before we move on to our next caller. As you might know, we have listeners from all sides of the fence. There are probably a lot of villains listening in right now. Got a message for them? Anybody you want to call out?""

Anti|Schuyler

""I've gotta bone up on the city's villain scene before I point too many fingers,"" he replies, ""so I'll just settle for this – I'm going to make this about keeping the city and its civilians safe. Keeping the peace. It's in the name.""

""If you're working against that? We'll see you soon.""

"Teller|GM

Shively park is a sparse place. A path leads from the south end of the park to the north, branching into two to encircle the centerpiece of the park, a wide, shallow green pond. The only trees are the ones clustered at the west end of the area.

Benches and trashcans line the path and various intervals. On one of the benches, Schuyler spots a woman who must be Cassette. At first glance, she looks more like a civilian playing dress-up than a parahuman. She's wearing white sneakers and a pair of worn jeans. A tight black t-shirt leaves her pale, muscled arms uncovered.

What clearly marks her as a hero is the form-fitting yellow spandex mask that over her head, and the bright yellow cape draped over her shoulders. She's not looking in his direction, the amber lenses over her eyes facing towards the pond.

Anti|Schuyler

He strolls up casually to the pond's shore, approaching her line of sight.

Teller|GM

She turns to look at him, expression hidden beneath her mask. This is the second cape he's run into with a fully covered face - maybe it's a common thing in Sicol Bend. She stands up.

""Hi,"" she says brightly, sticking out a hand for him to shake. Her fingernails are painted a bright yellow color. ""Nathaniel?""

Anti|Schuyler

""That's me,"" he replies, taking her hand into a firm grip. ""Nice to meet you, Cassette.""

Teller|GM

""Likewise,"" she says, and then lapses into silence.

Anti|Schuyler

""So, Trigger Finger tells me you're trying the independent hero thing, right?""

Teller|GM

""Not quite 'trying',"" she says, settling back onto the bench. ""I've been doing the independent hero thing for a long time. Some recent experiences made me think it would be a good idea to put together a team.""

Anti|Schuyler

Schuyler nods. ""I can offer that framework, if you're interested, but I think we should start by introducing ourselves further.""

""Did you hear my call-in on RFS?""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [3] +2 = 5

Teller|GM

""I listened in,"" she says, sounding hesitant. Uncomfortable? Nervous? He can't completely tell. ""I'm still curious about who you are, and what you're trying to do.""

""From what you said about Paramount, it sounds like you have principles. But what's your...philosophy? What do you believe?""

""Sorry, I'm not phrasing this right.""

Anti|Schuyler

""Keeping order. Maintaining harmony, even. Part of why I chose Sicol Bend was because I knew a team of heroes like this would be needed here.""

""The power vacuum Deep-Six's departure caused has already started a noticeable shift in the status quo. It's a tenuous situation, one that I can easily see devolving into chaos left unchecked.""

""That's... pretty surface-level, as far as my explanation goes, but let me know if I need to elaborate.""

Teller|GM

""Yeah,"" she says. ""You're making sense, but could you elaborate? We just met, and if we're going to work together, we should probably know about each other beyond the surface level.""

Anti|Schuyler

""I won't lie, part of this stems from personal pride on my part - proving that my principles, my methodologies, and survive and thrive, a better way of handling things than Paramount.""

""But I'm the kind of guy who tries to put together anything he sees falling apart, if you get me.""

""Hence Sicol, hence why I left Paramount.""

Teller|GM

""What do you think about PR?"" Cassette asks curiously. ""I sort of had it crammed down my throat when I was in the PRT.""

    ROLL: ""Schuyler’s Social"" [1] + 1 = 2

    ROLL: ""Cassette's Social"" [4] = 4

Her voice takes on a tone of distaste as she mentions PR.

Anti|Schuyler

""I'm not gonna stuff you in a costume you hate, though it'd be cool to have a unifying theme for our capes. Just a little logo or insignia, I'm thinking.""

""As far as public presentation goes, I just have a few rules of thumb that should be pretty easy to keep to, like 'don't be a huge dick to the press'. Stuff to make sure that nobody drags everyone else down by association, you dig me?""

Teller|GM

""Yeah,"" she says, nodding, but doesn't sound satisfied. Then she exhales.

""I said it got crammed down my throat, but that's a little misleading. What they taught me stuck with me, and I even ended up leaving when the Director decided he wanted a darker image.""

Suddenly, she asks, ""Have you heard about Slugger?""

Anti|Schuyler

""The... legbreaker, yeah? I know of him, but lack the finer details.""

Teller|GM

""Yeah, that's him,"" she says, shaking her head. ""I can give you finer details if we end up working together, but that's the short of it. A kid vigilante who runs around breaking people's knees and thinks he's a hero. Like, what the heck?""

""And I feel like it's our fault, you know?"" she says. He can feel her peering at him from beneath the mask. ""Not you, but heroes as a group. Look at the Protectorate, or Hands of an Angry God. We're not exactly setting the best example.""

""So I guess I'm saying I'd want you to stuff me into a costume I hated, if it helped. I'd...really be pushing the PR stuff, and the heroic image. I mean, it's not going to kill anybody to wear bright colors and smile once in awhile, right?""

Anti|Schuyler

""Ah,"" Schuyler says, raising an eyebrow. ""Image, presentation? That I can do.""

""You're saying you want me to turn you into a gleaming beacon of justice that makes the Protectorate look like a bunch of muggers by comparison?""

He cracks his knuckles, grinning wider than ever. ""That I can do, that I can do.""

Teller|GM

""Making that bunch look like muggers isn't too hard,"" Cassette says, sounding more relaxed than she did earlier. ""And not just appearing to be that way, either. Doing everything above board. Not looking the other way because we're scared of a villain, or they're threatening our puppies if we retaliate, or we're playing tit-for-tat and we owe them one.""

Now she sounds fired up. ""I'm not naive. I know it will be hard, that we won't always be perfect. But I don't think having a group of heroes who are actually good guys is too much for Sicol Bend to ask for.""

Anti|Schuyler

""Let me get this out of the way, first, Cassette. You're going to have a lot of questions, and what I'm about to say isn't set in stone. It's negotiable, and if it comes down to it, I can blow them off.""

""In the process of getting a headquarters set up, I had a negotiation with the Brotherhood. The HQ I have in mind happens to be within their area of influence.""

""For some reason, they're offering me money. I'll slow down here, let you ask what you need to ask.""

Teller|GM

""What?""

Anti|Schuyler

""... yeah. I'm feeling much the same way,"" Schuyler says, shaking his head.

""I was looking around for where to get set up in Sicol. I settled with Marimer, since it was a really well-situated. Then, I realized the Brotherhood was gonna strong-arm the shit out of me, so I wanted to meet with them to preempt that.""

""Have a discussion that was maybe a little less one-sided than them putting the kibosh on me.""

""But they offered me the real estate, even the money - and as much as I want to be completely heroic, coming into the city with three major groups opposing my very existence doesn't spell out a very long life for the Keepers.""

""Stop me anytime, by the way, it's a lot to take in. For myself as well,"" he continues, mouth twisting into a concerned expression.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [2] +2 = 4

Teller|GM

Cassette stands up. ""And you took it? They've been opposing my existence for years, so don't give me that sh- crap.""

Even without being able to see her face, her body language makes it clear how perturbed she is.

Anti|Schuyler

""I can turn them down,"" he says, palms out. ""I was in their manor, they had me off-kilter.""

He stops, shoulder slumping slightly, pausing, briefly at a loss for words.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [2] +2 = 4

Teller|GM

""The fact that you didn't already turn them down..."" she trails off. ""Look, I get it. I really do. I just don't think we'd work out.""

She holds her hand out. ""Good luck?""

Anti|Schuyler

He grimaces, then sighs, speaking before he accepts the handshake.

""I... it doesn't sit well with me either. I'm feeling worse about it as we speak.""

""If I manage to figure something out as far as getting... well, unaffiliated with them, d'you mind if I let you know?""

He reaches out, shaking her hand, with none of the vigor of the first handshake.

Teller|GM

""Sure,"" she says, a false cheeriness in her voice. Then, after standing there awkwardly for a second, she turns and begins jogging away, yellow cape fluttering behind her.

"Teller|GM

Ashcloud Akira stands on the roof of the warehouse - her warehouse, as she's come to think of it. Inconvenient and out of the way, it's one of the less frequently used buildings on the docks. Not the ideal place to squat, but there were worse.

The sun is directly overhead, bright light reflecting off of her armor. She should get moving before she's spotted - the docks are still busy, but lunch means it's as quiet as it'll be all day. If the workers told Thousand Hands about someone running around their territory in power armor...well, she'd be having a very different day than the one she had planned.

Panda|Ash

Okay. Okay. Okay. Today was the day. She'd been dreaming and planning and plotting and... grieving...

Pull it together. You got this.

Okay.

It's been long enough, the first steps of the plan came together today.

The young tinker, known by entirely too many names to people who weren't around any longer- and fuck didn't that still sting- decided that she'd start her grand journey off properly.

Activating the stealth function of the suit she'd been tinkering with off and on for the last few months, she makes her way off of the rooftop and begins carefully following the map of the city she uploaded to her phone.

Destination: The absolute poorest section of the city.

    ROLL: ""Dex - Sneak"" [5] +2 = 7

Teller|GM

The reflected sunlight dims, as pigments in the metal shift to become less conspicuous, mimicking the hue and intensity of light bouncing off of nearby surfaces, partially taking into account scatter and diffusion...she's not invisible, but she's taken on roughly the colorings of her surroundings.

A relatively low amount of people are out and about at this hour, and none of them really notice as Ash makes her way towards the south-east. Ghetto G-sus' territory. She barely needs the map on her phone - the buildings and streets become noticeably more dilapidated as she comes closer to her destination.

Panda|Ash

Okay okay okay.

Stay calm. Stay calm. Here to make an impression. A good one. Nobody here was responsible.

Ash breathes deeply as she heads deeper towards the core of the territory, physically calming herself for the confrontation to come.

Calm. Caaaaaalm.

She turns off the stealth function once she's deep enough that she's certain.

Then she casually walks down the street, in broad daylight, in a gleaming power suit.

Teller|GM

The street is pretty quiet. The one person in sight, an old woman coming outside to get her mail, takes one look at Ashcloud Akira and quickly decides that the bills can wait. She vanishes back inside of her house.

Panda|Ash

No time like the present.

Ash meanders over to the old woman's home as lackadaisically as possible when you're in a tinkertech power suit.

She rings the doorbell carefully then turns on the speakers.

""How do I find G-sus?""

I swear, on everything I love, if this bitch starts telling me about going to church I'm burning this entire fucking hou-

The tinker stops, takes another breath, and waits with a fake-ass smile on her face, even though nobody else can see it.

Teller|GM

The door remains shut, and for several long seconds there's no answer. Then: ""Why?""

The single word question is shouted from somewhere in the room just beyond the door.

Panda|Ash

Why...

Thoughts of Ralph and Jess and Little Blue and Big Blue flash through the mind of the woman known as Ashcloud Akira.

The forced smile wavers temporarily before she pushes cheer out like a cow giving birth.

""I'm new in town. I heard he's the only one around here who's not a complete asshole.""

Teller|GM

Another long pause. ""Keep walking around in the open with that armor, you'll get his attention. You'll be getting a lot of people's attention.""

""...if you're going to fight him, would you mind not doing it in front of my house? I'm on a fixed income, and I don't want my insurance premium going up.""

Panda|Ash

Laughter bubbles forth unexpectedly, but not in an entirely unwanted fashion.

""Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your time.""

She turns and walks away, still chuckling. Seems like Plan A was still on. 'Walk around in his territory before he showed up to make sure I wasn't causing trouble.'

And so her walk began.

Teller|GM

She walks up the curiously quiet streets. The occasional resident sees her approaching and quickly remembers that they have elsewhere to be, but for the most part her journey is a solitary one.

She manages to travel two blocks at her casual pace before she's interrupted by a man suddenly appearing on the street ahead of her, about three yards away. Ghetto G-sus.

He's a heavyset black man, the sort of person whose head would probably look too large for their body if they were thinner. His skin is smooth and soft looking, including the top of his bald head. He wears no mask, only an admittedly stylish white tracksuit and trainers.

""Hey,"" he says. The word is part greeting, part challenge.

Panda|Ash

""Hey,"" she calls back, before allowing the ambiance to build.

High noon? Searching for someone for what might end up as a fight? All of the civilians knowing to run back inside?

All she was missing was the snazzy revolver.

Ooh, could be added in la-

Focus.

""I'm new in town. I did my homework. Heard that you might be able to help me, without being a jackass about it?""

Teller|GM

He adjusts his stance, sticking his hands in the pockets of his jacket. ""Maybe maybe, baby. I don't know what you heard about me or what you want.""

A vision flashes through her head. Her suit, vanishing and reappearing like the man standing in front of her did. The outlines of a design, details blurry. She's certain they'd become clearer if she had a chance to see his power in action, dodging her attacks-

The vision vanishes.

Panda|Ash

No. No no no. Not now. Oh my goddess, though. Fucking teleportation functions!

She could combine that possibly with the Pulse array to-

No!

Ash shakes her head to clear her mind and turns back to the matter at hand.

""I'd love to talk in private,"" she calls as she slowly and deliberately takes a couple of steps forward. ""No disrespect to you by forcing this meeting on you, but I'd rather not attract any more attention than I already have. If the kids get home from school and see me, the entire city will know. Neither of us need that kind of heat.""

Teller|GM

""Whoever you talked to didn't tell you nothing,"" Ghetto G-sus says, spreading his arms out. ""I'm Ghetto G-sus, baby. Whatever the heat, I beat it.""

""'less you plan to talk for three, four hours, we're good right here. Now what did you want?""

Panda|Ash

""Shelter,"" she responds tersely. Temper temper. Taking a deep breath yet again, she explains.

""I need a place to sleep and quietly work on my tech without being disturbed. In exchange, I'll cause no troubles while I'm in the area and I'll pay back you and the citizens as soon as I get some cash.""

Teller|GM

""Listen,"" Ghetto G-sus says, in a voice that isn't unkind. ""You wanna, what, sleep on my sofa? I don't really do that sort of shit. I don't even know your fucking name.""

Panda|Ash

For the second time in as many hours, she laughs unexpectedly.

""Apparently that's what I'm asking. Huh, worded like that it does sound kinda fucked up,"" she laughs again, ""I go by Ashcloud Akira. You can call me Ash. I'll be back once I have something to pay 'rent' with.""

She starts to turn, to make the dramatic exit even more dramatic, then stops before she completes her moronic move.

""How do I hit you up if I'm feeling less... childish?"" Ash gestures to her suit then behind her to the path she walked before encountering the guardian.

Teller|GM

""Hold up,"" Ghetto G-sus says, holding up his hands. ""I want to be clear here. What do you mean by rent? Stolen money? Big Bad's head? I got a pretty good setup here already. Whatever you're selling, I ain't tryna buy it.""

Panda|Ash

A grin, even though he can't see it.

""You'll see. I'll just set something on fire, next time I want to talk. Fire's hard to ignore.""

She starts muttering to herself about what's appropriate to set on fire in his territory or not while also unconsciously meandering away from the hulking defender of the peace.

Teller|GM

""YO!"" he says, no longer sounding so friendly. He disappears and vanishes three times in a row, each teleportation bringing him closer to her. With the last, he's once again barring her way. ""You set any of my shit on fire, woman, and we're gonna have a motherfucking problem.""

Panda|Ash

Her eyes go wide with shock.

SHE DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO FIGHT HIM!

""THAT WAS SO FUCKING DOPE! DUDE, DO IT AGAIN! PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE!""

Fuck sounding distinguished, she needed that sweet sweet tech upgrade. Probably wouldn't be as quality due to the lack of fighting for it, but fuck it. Better than nothing and man that really was pretty cool.

Teller|GM

""Par-don?"" he says, exaggerating the word and scrunching his eyebrows at her.

Panda|Ash

""Hoooooo~ly shit, man!"" She's not even bothering to tamper down on her excitement, going so far as to step closer and peer at him in increasingly close and invasive ways.

""I've never seen a teleporter before! That was like, the 3rd coolest thing I've ever seen! Fuck, man, I see why people love you so much. Hunky and you teleport! Hnnnnnnng.""

She'll worry about cleaning up the drool later, right now, TELEPORTATION GET!

""One more time? Or maybe three? Pleaaaaase, pleaaaase?!""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [4] +1 = 5

Teller|GM

Ghetto G-sus stares, obviously perturbed by her behavior. ""Aight. First thing you need to do is get out of my face. Second thing you need to do is fuckin' chill.""

Panda|Ash

""Ahem, yeah. Y'know, whatever.""

She steps back a few steps and takes off her helmet so she can see this better, brushing a few damp strands of hair out of her face.

With a smile, Ash introduces herself properly. ""Sorry, I'm a Tinker. We get excited easily. I'm Cameron, pleased to meet you.""

She extends her right arm to shake while her left holds her helmet securely.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [5] +1 = 6

Teller|GM

""Ghetto G-sus,"" he responds, offering a faint wave instead of taking the offered hand. He doesn't look nearly so bothered now. ""So, I show you this teleportation again, you swear to keep the crazy shit on lock down? No yelling, no burning, no 'rent'?""

Panda|Ash

""Just trying to give a good impression. Can't blame a girl for wanting to, when you show up being all,"" she forgets how to word and instead gestures at the well-fitting tracksuit. Yes, flattery does have its place. ""Anywho, yeah, my b. I'll chill.""

Teller|GM

""Aight,"" he says again, looking like he doesn't quite believe the comment about the tracksuit, but like he certainly doesn't mind it. ""Watch this, then.""

He flickers, vanishing and reappearing at different points around Ash. He's not as fast as some of the movers she's seen, but she still has to turn her head quickly to keep up with him. With his last teleportation, he winds up directly in front of her, so that when she turns her head she finds his face is only a few inches from her. He grins and vanishes again, appearing a few feet back.

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud Akira’s Wits"" [3] = 3

He bows. ""Tada.""

Panda|Ash

Putting her helmet back on, Ash applauds while giving a wolf whistle to boot.

""That was so cool, thanks man. I think I'll get out of your hair, I have to look for another place to set up shop now. But maybe I can drop by and we can shoot the shit?""

Teller|GM

He seems to think about it for it a bit. ""Yeah. Yeah, alright. Just don't come around here when the kids'll be out. And I know that thing you're wearing's got weapons, but it doesn't when you're on my streets. Got it?""

Ashcloud Akira feels a small sense of disappointment unrelated to what he's saying. No, a lack of fulfillment. Things didn't go like she saw in the vision, and now the designs aren't as clear as she imagined they'd be either. Sections left empty, equations unbalanced...

Panda|Ash

Crap. Maybe more time around him will fix it. Oh well.

""Yes sir,"" Ash says saucily.

Giving a crisp salute, she walks away and turns her stealth function back on. She had one more stop to make before her work was done for the day.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Dex - Sneak"" [2] +2 = 4

Teller|GM

Ash begins making her way to the Clatsop Community college, one of Whirlwind's stomping grounds. Even with her stealth function, she's not as sneaky as she was earlier - a few people see her and drop their groceries, or start panicking and tugging on whoever's walking with them.

She's only about a quarter of the way there when a woman's voice calls out from behind her. ""You. Tinker.""

Panda|Ash

Yessss, please be someone I can punch. Please please please.

Ash turns around calmly, restraining the urge to vibrate from excitement.

""Me. Tinker. You. Conan?""

The internal smirk was well earned; she's fucking hysterical.

Teller|GM

The woman stands a dozen feet back. She's lithe and pale with reddish-brown hair, and is dressed in a well-fitting black suit. The only bit of color on her costume is a thin dark purple tie. She's wearing a black domino mask with a vaguely beak-like nose. How hadn't she spotted her? Dammit.

Any pedestrians that hadn't spotted Ash have done so now, and scramble to get out of the way of the pair.

""No. I'm Purple Parrot, from the Protectorate,"" the woman says calmly. ""I'm sure you understand that you frightened a lot of people, walking around in that thing?""

Panda|Ash

""Well, we all can't have great curves that fit into tight things. Some of us have a little,"" she bounces, turning off the stealth function at the same time, allowing the clanking noise to sound off properly, ""heft to work with.""

Hmmm. After Sicol Bend, world tour as a comedienne?

Note to self: Work on stand up act while tinkering.

""Anywho, people get frightened by a lot of things. I have a schedule to keep, so if you really want to talk, walk with me. Otherwise I'm going to cut this short. Maybe I can hit you up at the base later, we can get some drinks?""

The perfect- fuck what anyone else says- lines are delivered with a dual set of finger guns as Ash starts walking backwards, away from the heroine.

Teller|GM

""Okay,"" Purple Parrot says amicably. She begins to follow Ash, taking quick strides to catch up. ""Maybe if I'm with you, people won't be so concerned. You have to admit, that costume wasn't designed to be cuddly.""

""So, where are we headed?""

She falls into step besides Ashcloud. Now that the armor is fully visible, the crowd parts in front of them faster than the red sea.

Panda|Ash

""Well, you've blown my plan to hell and back for not being known in the city until I was ready."" She sighs loudly.

""Oh well, I'm headed to meet the Whirlwinds and talk to them about a business proposition,"" a sidelong glance at Legs walking beside her, ""so from what info I have on you, you aren't really a front line combatant type. So if you got sent out to talk to an unknown cape, either you aren't by yourself or you kick enough ass that you got it covered. Which is it?""

Teller|GM

""Maybe I just didn't peg you as the type to try to turn me into a smear on the sidewalk,"" Purple Parrot says, with a shrug. She seems confident and relaxed. ""Maybe you wouldn't be able to if you tried.""

She glances back at Ashcloud, mirroring her look. ""What do you want to talk to the Whirlwinds for, anyway? I have to ask - do you consider yourself a hero? A villain? Something else?""

Panda|Ash

""Hey, pause."" She stops walking, staring directly at the cape. ""Are you doing that freaky mirror thing? Like, is it on all the time or do you have to do it on purpose? Waaaait, we should have a dance off!""

Ooh, then maybe she'd get some idea on how to apply that to- damn it, Cam.

""Nevermind that,"" she mumbles and immediately sets off again, speed walking this time.

Teller|GM

""Hey, pause,"" Purple Parrot says, mimicking her tone and matching her walking speed. Ash can't quite tell if the hero sounds like the electronic version of her voice or how her real voice sounds to other people, but it's still damn close to sounding like her. ""No dance off, sorry, but you could come to the base and talk over drinks. I just need to make sure you're not off to do something shady - Whirlwind is made up of two bit criminals, but they're still criminals.""

Panda|Ash

""I can't tell if I'm annoyed or turned on by that,"" Ash admits to herself and her companion. With another sigh, she continues walking but finally stops dodging the intent. ""Look, I'm here on business. A... close friend of mine went missing recently, and I'm looking for answers. I have no intention of engaging in 'criminal activities' or whatever the fuck, but I'm not happy to be here.""

What a fucking understatement. ALL of it.

'not happy to be here' what a load of bullshit.

After I find the mot- no no no. Not now.

Breathe. Breathe. Okay. Okay. I got this.

""So, how about this, I'll stop by the base in oh... about a week? I'll unmask, you don't have to worry about it, and I'll take you out for drinks. THEN,"" she holds up a finger in amusement, ""you and I can work on see how dancing works with your power. With legs like those, I bet you could really cut a rug.""

    ROLL: ""Social"" [1] +1 = 2

    ROLL: ""Empathy"" [4] +1 = 5

Teller|GM

Purple Parrot doesn't blush, but she's obviously at least a little embarrassed by Ash's comments. Uncomfortable embarrassed, not shy-but-flattered embarrassed. Crap.

""We'll see,"" she says, with the same comfortable ease she displayed earlier. She gives her a friendly smile. ""How about you stop by tomorrow instead of next week? Maybe I could even help you find your close friend - I am a superhero, after all. Things like that are my job.""

Panda|Ash

""We'll see,"" Ash mimics in a similar fashion, not close enough to count, but the effort was all it took. ""You can let your superiors know I go by the name Ashcloud Akira. That's not quite a dismissal, but I'm almost where I need to be, and I can't show up with you in tow, so if you wouldn't mind...""

Teller|GM

""Remember, nothing criminal,"" Purple Parrot says by way of parting. She then mimics Ash's double finger guns from earlier, and turns to walk away.

They did, indeed, arrive at the entrance to Clatsop community college. It's not a massive place, but it's not small, either.

Panda|Ash

Ash mimes as if she's been shot in the corniest fashion and holds the pose for a moment while using a limp wrist to shoo Legs away.

That taken care of, Ash turns and walks into the depths of the college, with basically the same plan she had for meeting Ghetto G-sus: wait until some shit went down.

Teller|GM

Ashcloud Akira stomps down the sidewalk, passing terrified college students and faculty. It's a nice campus - trimmed greens, modern architecture, a smart layout. The ambient atmosphere is only ruined by the screaming and running.

Nobody seems to be running towards her, however, especially not anyone in a costume.

Panda|Ash

On the cusp of losing her fucking mind, she raises both hands up high and yells, ""Quit running and screaming damn it, and I'll be gone in just a few quick minutes! Everybody just chill!""

Teller|GM

Nobody stops. Although now there is a man approaching her, a...security guard? Public safety officer? Some pseudo-cop.

""Alright. S-Stay where you are,"" he says. ""What do you want?""

Panda|Ash

""All I want is to talk to anyone who,"" here she uses air quotes, ""may or may not know anything about Whirlwind, especially any of the capes.""

Ash looks around at the panicked crowd and sighs. ""Look, I'm not remotely interested in fighting any of you, especially not here. My cousin's in this crowd. So chill, people, just want to have a conversation- which will take place outside of the campus- then I'll be on my way. Alright?""

Teller|GM

The screaming dies down, as does the running. Most people look like they still want to flee, but at least most of them are going about it in an orderly fashion now.

""Uh,"" one reedy looking guy squeaks out. ""Maybe try the high school. I hear two of them go there.""

""Kyle!"" A girl in flip-flops snaps at him.

""What? Sorry I don't want to get killed?"" Kyle whines.

Panda|Ash

""Hey, if they show up or if anyone speaks to them, let them know to keep an eye out for me. Nothing big, just business. I'm kind of a fan, that's all.""

Looking around at the ridiculousness, she shakes her head in disappointment.

""Thanks Kyle, if you want a job, send the word. Later everyone, have a great day!""

Actual, sustained flight would be perfect for a time like this. Instead of flying off like a badass, however, Ashcloud Akira starts walking away. With no explosions going off. Just walking. Ugh.

Teller|GM

""Uh, cool. Thanks,"" Kyle calls out after her. Flip-flops smacks him on the arms and starts reaming him out as Ashcloud Akira leaves.

Somehow, she's not surprised to find Purple Parrot waiting for her back at the entrance, sitting patiently on the short stone wall. The hero hops down and lands on the sidewalk near her. ""Hey.""

Panda|Ash

""Something something, mildly flirtatious commentary, something something, deflecting your inquiries, something something, yes, of course you're still here.""

Flippantly, Ash continues walking without a care in the world.

""What exactly do you want?""

Teller|GM

""Yes, of course I'm still here,"" Purple Parrot says, quickly falling into step besides her again. ""I knew I would have just been called back two minutes later.""

""Whatever you're trying to do, I - and by I, I mean the Protectorate - needs you to stop stomping around terrifying people. It's not strictly illegal - maybe disrupting the peace - but the bigger point is, scared people are stupid people. Something's going to happen.""

""You're not Dragon - people aren't going to fawn, they're going to freak,"" she says, with an apologetic shrug. ""Nobody knows if you're a good guy or a psycho. Try establishing yourself.""

Panda|Ash

""Good,"" Ash said, tired and drained from the stress of the day and the restraint necessary to continue.

""I have no time for the games and masquerade shit. I came here for a reason. If walking around in broad daylight while doing absolutely nothing aside from talking is enough to get the job done, then good. Maybe being completely unknown and unpredictable will help. If not, I'll conform then.""

Working on the extended flight system was going to have to be a must. Fuck this walking everywhere shit. No can do.

""I'll assume that whatever I say to you will make its way back to everyone else you know, so I'll keep it clear: I have no quarrel with the Protectorate. And once I have what I came here for, I'll gladly leave this shitty city. If at all possible, I'll do it with just as much damage as I caused today. As a fellow cape, I'm sure you know that's impossible. Purely by virtue of being a tinker, if nothing else."" A deep breath. A calming breath. ""So, I'll do what I'm here to do, then I'll get you that drink I promised, then I'm gone. Will I have to be concerned about less... diplomatic babysitters in the future?""

Teller|GM

""We have no quarrel with you,"" Purple Parrot says. ""We - I would like to help you, if possible. But if you ignore my advice about establishing yourself as a good guy and things take a bad turn, don't be surprised if the PRT doesn't peg you as a hero.""

She tilts her head slightly, no doubt listening to something on her earpiece. ""Fu...dge. I have to go. If you're coming to the HQ for a drink, try to make it sooner rather than later, alright? I think a talk would be good.""

She looks ready to sprint off, but stands still, waiting for a response.

Panda|Ash

""Noted,"" Ash prepares to shoo her away but then she finally stops being prideful for a moment, long enough to actually think.

""If... you could see if there's any information on a gang called the 'Yellowjackets', I'd owe you one. They came here some time ago and my friend was with them. They never left, apparently. So yeah, ahem."" She clears her throat and ignores the burning at the corners of her eyes. ""Go ahead and do your thing, I'll see you around.""

Teller|GM

""Yellowjackets,"" Purple Parrot says, thinking for a second. ""Yeah, I've heard of them, and could see about pulling some info on them for you.""

She begins backing away. ""I'll tell you when you come by for drinks.""

She then turns and sprints up the road with surprising speed, soon disappearing from sight around a corner.

"Teller|GM

It's two days after Schuyler's disheartening meeting with Cassette. In the intervening time period, she's announced the launch of her own group, Zenith, on RFS. Not the best news.

Better news, however, is how quickly his HQ has come along. He managed to get a large and surprisingly inexpensive building near the beach, and the sale went quickly. The building is still being furnished, but the crew working on it assure him that it will be habitable by the end of the week at the latest.

He's standing outside of the building, discussing how he wants his office laid out with the designer, when his phone begins buzzing in his pocket.

Anti|Schuyler

The roadblock with Cassette has been painful. Another enemy, and not one he can directly handle.

Ironically, her schism with him may have forced him closer to the Brotherhood by necessity, now that he lacks the expertise and knowledge regarding Sicol Bend's history of the former experienced Ward and independent hero.

He's trying hard not to think on it, and the incoming phone call may well be a welcome distraction.

Fishing the device out of his pocket, he glances first at the caller ID, then answers the call.

Teller|GM

It's an unknown number. Not wholly unexpected, given that his contact info is on the Keeper's website.

""This the Keeper?"" A woman's voice asks abruptly, barely waiting until he's touched the phone to his ear.

Anti|Schuyler

""The Keepers, yes,"" Schuyler responds. ""I'm Nathaniel Schuyler, the owner and manager. How may I help you today?""

Teller|GM

""You're lookin' for capes, huh?""

Anti|Schuyler

""That's correct."" Well, at least someone's biting.

Teller|GM

There's a pause, followed by a distant hacking cough. Then the woman continues, voice now with a hint of phlegm. ""Might have one. You payin'?""

Anti|Schuyler

He shakes his head, clearing away distractions, and decides to follow the woman's tack, shedding the formalities and precise diction.

""No shit,"" he replies, ""this isn't some volunteer job. It's gonna be close to what the Protectorate's offering.""

Teller|GM

""Mmm,"" the woman says, sounding more interested. ""Close? That mean above or below? Protectorate said 50K a year.""

That number doesn't sound right to him at all. Even starting members make about 80K a year...unless they're Wards, who get that much put into a trustfund each year.

Anti|Schuyler

""Shit, they're lowballing you,"" he scoffs. Is the person on the other line underage? He'll ask later, but hook her first. ""Where I'm from, it's 70K starting off, which I plan to match.""

Teller|GM

""I got other offers too,"" the woman says. ""From that other woman, Zenith. She's offerin' just as much, so I'm thinking of going with her.""

Her attempts at haggling are blatant.

Anti|Schuyler

""Cassette's crew, eh?"" Schuyler plays along.

""Don't get me wrong, I like the kid, but she doesn't know how to run a team like I do.""

""Cash isn't the end-all be-all,"" he elaborates. ""I have the know-how, the expertise, to help you make it big - if you wanted to work with her, you'd be punching muggers day-in day-out. Fifth page of the newspaper at best.""

""Not to mention, of course,"" he says, shifting from slang and colloquialisms to his used-car-salesman patter, ""you work with me, you get perks.""

He leaves that line hanging, waiting for her to bite.

Teller|GM

""Perks, huh?"" she bites.

Anti|Schuyler

""As we speak,"" Schuyler says, injecting a lot of pride into the statement, ""I'm getting a slick new Keepers headquarters put together in the background. Residential accommodations for my capes, training facilities.""

He's been meaning to brag about the headquarters to someone, so it's gratifying that he can do so and pitch the team to a prospective candidate at the same time.

Teller|GM

""Oh,"" she says, sounding uninterested in his slick new HQ. It superficially wounds him. ""You take kids?""

The numerous legal hurdles that come with managing minors rush through his head. On the other hand, another cape...

Anti|Schuyler

""How old?"" he responds, more than a little put-off by her blowing off his pride and joy.

There's a deep concern, lurking at first at the mention of the Wards salary, then blossoming at the realization that he might well have to contend with the Youth Guard breathing down his throat.

Teller|GM

""Fifteen,"" the woman says. ""Not a problem for someone with your expertise, right?""

Anti|Schuyler

""I can swing it,"" Schuyler responds, deciding to be frank with the girl, ""but the legal shit? That's a real pain in my ass, liable to slow me down right as I'm getting my setup off the ground.""

""So you're gonna have to show me you're worth it, that you're willing to play ball, yeah?""

Teller|GM

The woman laughs, and then begins hacking. It takes her a few seconds to regain her breath. ""Not me. My daughter.""

""She can be a handful, but I promise, she's a good kid deep down,"" she continues. ""Just needs...a good environment.""

Anti|Schuyler

""Ha! Sorry about that."" Despite the faux pas, it puts the concerns about guardianship somewhat to rest.

""You wanna fill me in a little more about her, or maybe meet up somewhere? My office is still under construction, so I got time.""

Teller|GM

""Yeah. Yeah, you can meet her,"" she says. ""Office is- oh, uh...somewhere else we should go?""

Anti|Schuyler

""You know the town better than me,"" he says, ""so I'm open to suggestions, but otherwise, Shively Park works.""

Teller|GM

""Yeah, that's not too far,"" she says. ""We can be there in a few minutes.""

Anti|Schuyler

""See you then,"" he says. He's grinning again, shaking off the funk that Cassette's rejection has put him in. There's a lead to chase, now, and just maybe, another member of the team to bring on board.


●  ●  ●


Teller|GM

He's back in Shively Park again, meeting with another cape. Is this becoming a pattern? If so, he's determined to change at least the ending of it. He's freshly showered and dressed sharply, ready to turn the charm to the maximum.

The park is empty when he arrives. He has to wait for a few minutes before two figures emerge from the west end of the park. One is a gawky black girl, dressed in jeans and a nice black blouse. Her hair is made into three thick, long braids that reach the middle of her back. She seems unhappy to be here, and is being all but dragged by an overweight woman Schuyler assumes is her mother. The woman is wearing a yellow t-shirt and white pants, hair tied back in a simple bun. She waves to Schulyer as she approaches.

Anti|Schuyler

""Hey,"" he says, walking up to the two, extending a handshake for the mother. ""How's it going?""

Teller|GM

""Hey,"" the mother says, shaking his hand. Her gaze moves up and down his body, and she holds the handshake a lot longer than necessary. ""We're good. I'm Jewel, this is Aliyah.""

The girl crosses her arms, not really looking at Schuyler.

Anti|Schuyler

After breaking the handshake, Schuyler turns his attention to the prospective hire. ""Hey, Aliyah. I'm guessing your mom has filled you in on the basics, but what's your take on this? Got any questions for me?""

Teller|GM

""Nope,"" Aliyah says simply. Jewel glares at her.

""She doesn't wanna join up with you,"" Jewel explains. ""But like I told her, I'm not going to have her running around doing who knows what. She needs supervising.""

Anti|Schuyler

He raises an eyebrow. ""What d'you want out of all of this, Aliyah?""

He remembers being a stubborn kid, once, and he's thinking he should try and present himself as someone on her side, rather than her mother's.

Teller|GM

""What do you mean, what do I want?"" she asks, sounding annoyed. ""I don't want any of this.""

Anti|Schuyler

""This being joining any sort of team, us, Zenith, the Protectorate or otherwise?""

He turns to her mother briefly, asking, ""Could you elaborate on her 'running around', Jewel?""

    ROLL: ""Social - Trustworthy/Attractive"" (2) [4] (4) +2 = 6

Teller|GM

Aliyah purses her lips at the question, and Jewel suddenly looks nervous.

""Getting into trouble around the city,"" she says slowly, then suddenly decides to trust Schuyler. ""Calling herself 'Brigand' and stealing stuff. Got herself caught by a cape, who brought her home instead of locking her up. He didn't want her to end up in the Wards.""

""So she can have all the attitude she wants, but she will be joining your group.""

Anti|Schuyler

""Hmm,"" Schuyler muses, thin-lipped. He turns back to Aliyah. ""How long you think you can last in Sicol, pulling shit like that?""

Teller|GM

""And what would you know about it?"" she mutters.

Anti|Schuyler

""You keep going the way you are,"" he elaborates, ""how long is it gonna take before someone really kicks your teeth in? You're small-time, sure, but what happens when you cross a gang, or one of the vigilantes who doesn't know how to pull their punches gets their hands on you?""

""Of course, with the new Director, I'm betting the Protectorate's fixing to start cracking down. You might not get a choice, joining the Wards, next time.""

Scared-straight probably isn't the most persuasive method, but he'd prefer no recruit to a recalcitrant one. Who knows - as a backup plan, this girl might be a thorn in the PRT's side.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [4] +1 = 5

Teller|GM

When he mentions the gangs and vigilantes, Aliyah's expression changes slightly. He clearly struck something, there.

""Mmm-hmm,"" Jewel chimes in unhelpfully.

Anti|Schuyler

""So I wanna know why you're out there, risking yourself, putting yourself in harm's way, doing what you're doing despite the risks of running into the Brotherhood, Tigers, or any number of other capes that won't hesitate to take you down.""

Teller|GM

""Why not?"" Aliyah says callously. Jewel shakes her head.

""I'm sorry, this girl can just be..."" Jewel apologizes.

Anti|Schuyler

""It's not for money, otherwise you'd be a little more interested in my offer,"" he says, tapping his fingers on his thigh in irritation.

""What is it, then? For kicks? Thinking about proving yourself, getting an in with one of the bigger gangs?""

Teller|GM

""Like I'm going to see a cent of that,"" Aliyah mutters. Louder, she says, ""Kicks, I guess.""

""You know that this money-"" Jewel starts.

""I KNOW, mom,"" Aliyah says loudly, cutting her off.

Anti|Schuyler

It might be rude, but he has to know what he's getting into here. Schuyler presses the two of them, waiting for the silence to draw out a little, slightly uncomfortable, then breaking it. ""... what about the money?""

Teller|GM

""It'll get us a better place, pay some of her father's hospital bills,"" Jewel says, continuing to confide in Schuyler. Aliyah looks annoyed, bordering on angry.

Anti|Schuyler

""So you're telling me you got no sympathy for the old man?"" Schuyler asks the girl, raising an eyebrow.

Teller|GM

""No, it's - fuck, why are you all up in our business?"" Aliyah demands, frustrated.

""Watch your damn mouth,"" Jewel snaps. ""And you're fifteen, you don't get to have business.""

Anti|Schuyler

He shakes his head at that. ""She's gonna have to have some business if she signs on. If she's working with me, we'd have to work together. I'm trying to piece together why joining the Keepers sounds like such a shit deal to you, Aliyah.""

Teller|GM

""I don't like you,"" Aliyah says, shrugging. ""Your organization sounds like crap. And you say I risk running into the Brotherhood or Tigers and shit, but if I'm a hero, it sounds like I'm going to be looking for them.""

""Last hero I ran into, he tattled on me,"" she says. ""What sounds safer to you?""

This time, Jewel doesn't snap at her about her language.

    ROLL: ""Schuyler’s Social"" [3] +1 = 4

It sounds plausible enough, but also like she's still dancing around something she doesn't want to talk about.

Anti|Schuyler

He takes the more direct approach, trying to shift gears from smooth-talking into the social equivalent of blunt force.

Schuyler's mouth tightens, and he allows his irritation to show through. ""You're not shooting straight with me here. There's something you're avoiding.""

Teller|GM

Aliyah simply crosses her arms again and narrows her eyes. Stubborn.

Anti|Schuyler

""Look,"" he says, shrugging. ""You play ball with me, or you don't play at all. I'm not about to work with someone who's going to fight me at every turn.""

This time, the ultimatum is moreso delivered at her mother.

Teller|GM

""Excuse us,"" Jewel says, and drags Aliyah bodily to the side.

    ROLL: ""Jewel"" (5) [6] = 6

    ROLL: ""Aliyah"" [2] = 2

After a few minutes of hushed yelling, the pair return, Aliyah scowling.

""Well?"" Jewel demands. Aliyah looks at Schuyler.

""I'll. Play. Ball."" she says, dragging out and exaggerating each word. ""But you're not getting my entire damn life story.""

Anti|Schuyler

Schuyler grimaces slightly, raising an eyebrow as he does so. ""Y'know... I'm not very convinced.""

Teller|GM

Aliyah shrugs again.

""She'll behave,"" Jewel ways, making it sound more like a warning to Aliyah than a reassurance to Schuyler. ""Trust me.""

Anti|Schuyler

""I get that,"" he says, placatingly, ""but you can't keep her in line all the time. She keeps on with that attitude, without the actual drive it takes to become a hero, that's gonna shoot me in the foot before I even have the time to get off the ground.""

He's shaking his head slightly, murmuring, ""I'm not sure if we can work something out.""

Teller|GM

""Guess we're done, then?"" Aliyah asks, earning a smack on the arm from her mother.

""I don't want to stick her in the Wards, and your 75K is better than what Zenith's offering,"" Jewel says. He recalls saying 70K. ""We could really use it. And I can't have her running around the city being a 'brigand'.""

Anti|Schuyler

The shaking of his head becomes more pronounced. ""It's not worth my money to hire someone who's going to fight me every step of the way. Sorry.""

Teller|GM

""Fine,"" Jewel makes a face, and then grabs Aliyah by the arm. ""Come on.""

She marches back the way they entered the park, dragging the girl behind with her. She keeps her arms crossed the entire time, even as she stumbles after her mother.

Anti|Schuyler

Another failure, but one he doesn't feel quite as bad about. Cassette's refusal was worse, but Aliyah... she felt like a liability, through and through.

Silently praying that not every cape he tries to hire is going to be like that, he finds the nearest park bench, leaning back into it, staring at the sky in frustration.

Ashcloud Akira arrives on the Clatsop community college campus once again. It's twenty past four, so she attributes the quiet of the campus to the fact that many students are at home by now. A few remaining individuals are walking between buildings, students and staff, but none have taken notice of her yet.

Panda|Ash

Okay, okay. So apparently these are high schoolers? That hang out at a college?

Don't get it, but whatever. Still need to see them, so let's try this again.

She wanders around, looking for an individual who might be hanging out and not paying a terrible amount of attention. Undoubtedly anyone else would turn and run, but at least this way questions could get asked before they realized they were talking to someone in a tinkertech suit.

No clue why that's so terrifying. Tsk.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [5] = 5

Teller|GM

People do, in fact, flee as she approaches. Others keep a safe distance, but point and mutter to each other.

""It's that Tinker again,"" someone says, sounding like it's the best thing that's happened to them all day.

After a minute or two of wandering, she spies a girl dressed too warmly for the weather, in jeans and a hoodie, leaning against a building and flipping through her phone, earbuds in. There is also a person-shaped lump of clothes on a bench, likely an exhausted student.

Panda|Ash

Akira is reminded, briefly, of Jordan, the young orphan of the group who refused to do anything other than dress and act like her 'mentor', Darius.

The two were close as father and daughter, thicker than thieves, and twice as clever. Always seen in matching hoodies and draped across a nearby surface as if they were part of the furnishings.

It worked for Darius, lanky figure he was, dude could hug at least four people with a single arm- or so the common joke went.

Jordan, being only a fraction of his size and age, wasn't quite for it, but she tried her hardest. Adorable.

The pain of their loss has the tinker stumble on her path, but with a quick shake of the head and a core of burning from deep within, she continues on as if nothing happened.

Soon...

She gets close and leans against the wall, arranged in a way that if the girl tried to run, she wouldn't get far without being yanked back, simultaneously pulling an earbud out of the girl's ear.

""Yo.""

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [6] = 6

The girl looks over with an annoyed expression and the beginnings of a sharp word on her tongue, but both die when she sees Ashcloud. She inhales sharply, but doesn't flinch or run.

She swallows once, takes in Akira's costume, then swallows again before speaking. A barely audible, hesitant, ""Yo.""

Panda|Ash

""'m Akira. Need some help, think you could help?""

She tries so so hard to keep the grin out of her voice. But man, the reaction was delicious, shit.

Teller|GM

The girl isn't blinking. She swallows again. ""How?""

Panda|Ash

Ashcloud's grin isn't appropriate for... anything, really. She doesn't care in the least bit.

""Whirlwind. I want to talk to anyone who's clicked up with them. You look smart. Who do I need to talk to?""

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [2] = 2

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Stealth"" [3] = 3

""I don't know,"" the girl says carefully. ""Not my scene. Sorry.""

Panda|Ash

The grin spreads further. Oh boy oh boy oh boy.

""One of those snitches get stitches things, eh? Love it! You know... you never introduced yourself. How... disrespectful."" Her tone drops abruptly.

Teller|GM

""Liz,"" the girl says. Her eyes have to be hurting by now.

Panda|Ash

""Blink, love."" Akira croons, amusement in her voice. It'd been so long since she'd gotten to indulge like this. ""How about this, do you know someone who might know? And as a hypothetical, if buildings around here started to... Iunno, break suddenly, how long do you think it'd be before someone from Whirlwind showed up to talk to me? Jus' curious.""

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [4] +2 = 6

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [5] = 5

She feels something heavy thump into the back of her armor. It's not enough to bowl her over, but it does make her shift a few inches to compensate. From the weight and the feel of the arms of wrapped around her neck, it's a person. He grunts.

""Run!"" he yells. Liz takes a step backwards, but reconsiders fleeing when she sees how ineffective her would-be rescuer is.

Panda|Ash

More amused than anything at this point, the Tinker activates a small function which causes a thumbnail-sized oval to appear in her palm. She places the hand on Liz, aiming to slip the oval inside of her hoodie's pocket at the same time.

""Don't move. It'd be rude. I don't want to have to find you.""

She turns then to address her attacker with a grin on her face, regardless of the lack of people able to see it.

""Bloody or well-done?""

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [5] +1 = 6

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] = 1

Her assailant falls off of her back and lands heavily on the ground. It's an overweight kid, glasses knocked askance and backpack hanging half-off his back. He cringes.

""Oh God! Oh God!"" he says, trying to shield himself with his arm, as if that would help if she wanted to do something to him.

Liz stops moving when Akira touches her, freezing so thoroughly it's like she expects Akira to murder them both if she so much as breathes.

Panda|Ash

""Poor thing,"" she chuckles before extending an arm slowly to the fallen attacker. ""Come on, let's help you up. Can respect you trying to fight a cape to save your girlfriend. Mad respect.""

Teller|GM

The kid slowly, shakily takes her arm, more out of fear than anything. That, and a glimmer of hope that, just maybe, he won't be dying today.

""Not my boyfriend,"" Liz mumbles. ""I don't even know him.""

""W-we're in Econ together,"" the kid says. Liz gives him a murderous look.

""Shut. Up,"" she says.

Panda|Ash

""Ha!""

She snorts abruptly and loudly. ""Still get my respect. But don't try that again, not everyone is as charming as me!""

After helping the kid up, the tinker strikes a pose where she's pointing her thumbs at herself exaggeratedly, holding it for a few seconds before returning to leaning against the wall.

""'s your name, kid? You got stones. I'm Akira.""

Teller|GM

""L-Lyle,"" he forces out.

Panda|Ash

""Nice to meet you. Now, I was just asking Liz here a question or two that I don't thiiiink you have the answer to. She was just about to answer when you interrupted..."" She trails off before looking at Liz to see if the girl gives off any hints that she knows about Whirlwind membership.

    ROLL: ""Social - Empathy"" [2] +2 = 4

Teller|GM

If Liz knows anything, her face doesn't reveal it. Lyle, however, looks obviously confused when Akira says Liz's name, then quickly tries to hide it.

""What I said earlier is true. Not my scene,"" Liz says, her voice a monotone.

Panda|Ash

Cameron Young, the woman known as Ashcloud Akira, was not a patient woman.

After dealing with parents and a family that she never got along with, she got fed up and left for something better.

In the military, she had a temporary new family, and freedom of a different sort, but... an aching within her for something better was left unfulfilled, so instead of waiting for years to see if it evened out, she left when she had the chance.

So on and so forth, through the years, where the woman lacked patience to wait and let things be.

This was no different.

""I... I'm trying to be nice. Polite, even. My name is,"" she leans in close to 'Liz's' face, ""Ashcloud Akira. What imagery does that put in mind that you think it's okay to fuck with me? What kind of a fake name is ""Liz"" anyway?""

She backs away, trying and failing to center herself.

""How much of this school needs to burn before I get a truthful answer, child?""

Teller|GM

Liz narrows her eyes at Lyle, then closes her eyes for the first time since they've been talking. She looks like her legs don't want to hold her anymore, but she remains standing. ""Sorry. My real name is Macy. I didn't want to give you my real name - I have no idea who you are or what you want.""

Still keeping her eyes closed, she continues. ""But that's the only thing I lied about. I really don't know anything about Whirlwind.""

""I'll....find out. If you want. Talk to people.""

Her voice is still surprisingly level.

Panda|Ash

Still straining and struggling to maintain some semblance of calm, Cameron speaks softly.

""You have 15 minutes.... 14 minutes, 57... 14 minutes, 53... 14 minutes, 49...""

Teller|GM

""Wait, what?"" Macy opens her eyes, her voice finally showing a hint of panic. ""Now? There's hardly anybody here. Or...what do you expect from me in fifteen minutes?""

""I, uh, can try, calling some people,"" Lyle offers. ""Maybe-""

""Shut up,"" Macy says.

Panda|Ash

""Four- teen,"" Akira spreads the word out, mask pointed directly at Macy without any other indicator of her previous leniency. ""13 minutes, 58...""

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [2] = 2

Macy slides down the wall into a sitting position on the ground. ""I can't. This isn't-""

She stops talking at Akira's unrelenting facade, and sets her teeth. ""Fine, you...""

She trails off and slowly pulls out her phone. Before using it, she says, in a very controlled, pointedly calm voice, ""I'm not calling the police or anything. I'm texting people to see if anyone can connect me to Whirlwind. Is that okay for me to do?""

Panda|Ash

""13 minutes, 32,"" is the only response she gets before the tinker resumes her stony silence.

Teller|GM

""I'm going to take that as a yes,"" Macy says, and begins tapping at her phone. ""Lyle, start texting people, now.""

Lyle pulls out his phone with shaky fingers and drops it on the ground, where it clatters loudly. He winces, and then snatches it back up and begins typing out a message.

""Make it sound like you're trying to score drugs or something,"" Macy says, without looking up. ""Don't say that we're being threatened by a Tinker.""

""I'm...I'm not a moron, Macy,"" he says, sounding offended.

""I'm making sure we're on the same page,"" Macy says. Her voice is calm, but her grip on her phone tightens. ""I'd rather not die, Lyle.""

Panda|Ash

""Oh, if either of you want to get ice cream after this, I'm buying. Suddenly craving a triple scoop of mint chocolate and rocky road like nobody's business. Mmmmmmm,"" the Tinker salivates inside of her armor while she pointedly doesn't keep as meticulous track of time as it seemed she was. Appearing to be keeping track of time did as good a job as actually knowing what time it was down to the seconds.

But the ice cream thing was legit. Whirlwind meeting, ice cream cone, then PRT. They knew something about the Yellowjackets...

Whatever, that's in the future.

Now, drooling over ice cream while remaining at least a tiny bit aware.

Teller|GM

Macy and Lyle don't respond to the offer of ice cream. They've both lapsed into silence, focused wholly on their phones.

Whatever people there were on campus have cleared out, or are steering clear of this area. It's only when the count reaches 'ten' (approximately, she's thinking more about ice cream than the time) does Akira see someone approaching...a small black dot in the sky, growing larger by the second.

Panda|Ash

Hmm. If it was Whirlwind... it'd have to be... Brutus? Yeah, that was the one that flew.

Akira shifts slightly closer to the girl and boy, just in case, and continues watching the dot.

Teller|GM

Lyle jumps when Akira shifts, and then follows her gaze to the dot in the sky. Macy continues texting furiously, as if - well, as if her life depended on it.

The black dot quickly grows into a person, who does indeed match the description of Whirlwind's Alexandria package. He's tall, black, and muscled. He wears a spandex shirt - it's black with long grey sleeves, and the small logo of the athletic company is visible on his chest. He's also wearing grey track pants and black shoes.

The upper portion of his head and face is covered by a form-fitting gray mask, leaving only his eyes and slender jaw visible.

He slows before hitting the ground, and touches down lightly a short ways away from Akira. ""What are you doing here?""

Macy finally looks up from her phone, then goes limp with relief.

Panda|Ash

""Macy and.... Leo- no... Lars? No wait, Kyle! Yeah. Macy and Kyle, you two were great, I'll get you ice cream and cash for the job later. Might hire you two, pretty cool kids.""

Without a second glance, she walks towards Brutus, stopping a respectful distance away before nodding her head at him.

""Yo. I've been trying to contact someone from your group. Have a business proposal. Wanna walk and talk?""

Teller|GM

Lyle scrambles to collect himself, grabbing his backpack and stuffing his phone into his pocket. Macy stands up too, but slowly.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [5] = 5

""Wait!"" she says loudly. Brutus looks between Akira and Macy.

Panda|Ash

""One second, sorry,"" Akira nod apologetically to Brutus before turning back to Macy. ""What?""

Teller|GM

""I don't want cash, I don't want ice cream, I don't want a job,"" Macy says, her voice empty of emotion. ""I want to never see you again. I don't want anything to do with this.""

Lyle looks horrified at her forwardness. He begins backing away from her, preparing to run away if Akira looks inclined to fire a ray-gun or something.

Panda|Ash

Akira chuckles, ""Sure thing, squirt. Shoo.""

She turns back to Brutus. ""My b. Now, where were we?""

Teller|GM

Macy turns and leaves, her steps shaky at first, then fast and sure. Lyle dashes away ahead of her.

""Business proposition,"" Brutus says skeptically. He's glaring.

Panda|Ash

""I'm in a goddamn Tinker suit, in the middle of the day, for the second fucking day in a row, at a damn community college."" She glares back, ""What the fuck else do you think I'm doing this for? For a fight? I mean, it'd be a fun workout and all, but is currently counterproductive.""

Teller|GM

""I should kick your ass for pulling this shit here,"" Brutus says. Cocky. ""Talk before I make up my mind.""

Panda|Ash

""As if you could,"" she stretches slightly, anticipation thrumming throughout her body, ""I heard you're all small time. Nipping at the heels of the bigger gangs. I'm offering... more. In exchange for resources. Simple.""

Teller|GM

""I could,"" Brutus says simply. ""Cut to the chase.""

Panda|Ash

""One of the Three killed my friends."" Cameron pauses, breath hitching. No. She gave her last tears at the last funeral. No more until she finished.

Okay. Calm. Centered.

""You're a bunch of small time thugs. Useless in the grand scheme of things. Your leadership is sketchy. Bring me in. When we find who did it, and I... lay my demons to rest, you can expand into their territory and move however you want from there.

""A temporary alliance. I help you expand, grow, get your name out there. Make sure that you aren't stomped like insects the next time you piss off one of the big three. In exchange, I get some closure. For my friends.""

Teller|GM

""Bring you in how?"" Brutus demands.

Panda|Ash

""You're a rude sort, aren't you? Tsk. Unless any of you have military experience or know anything worth shit about tactics, I'd be leading the fight until the target is taken care of. How long that takes is up to you."" She stares at him, hungrily. Chances are he'd say no then a fight'd break out. She could get what she wanted just as easily over his broken body as she could from diplomacy.

His choice.

Teller|GM

""So your business proposition is a hostile takeover?"" Brutus says, shaking his head. ""Goddamn.""

He takes a step forward. ""Get the fuck out of here. Seriously - get out of here. Don't come back.""

Panda|Ash

She sighs and takes a step forward herself.

""It only had to be hostile to someone else. Maybe you should talk to whoever holds your leash. Don't think you should be too rash here.""

Teller|GM

Brutus begins strolling forward towards her. ""Leave. Final warning.""

From around a corner, but three buildings down, she sees two darkly figures approaching. One is tall and appears to be wearing a robe, the other is a short girl in a black dress. Oh great - Protectorate.

Panda|Ash

Ashcloud Akira, fully wreathed in her persona at this point, strides forward, shaking out her limbs and priming her weaponry.

Oooooooooooooh how it'd been forever since she had a good brawl to shake off the cobwebs.

""So be it,"" she says softly, waiting for the blow that was sure to come, putting the Protectorate out of her mind.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [3] +2 = 5

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [5] +1 = 6

Brutus steps forward and slams his fist into her, catching her on her left arm. The blow is...surprisingly weak - she doesn't even feel it through her armor. He stands in front of her, fists raised and eyes narrowed.

""Hey!"" the robed figure bellows, approaching as quickly as he can. Oz. He holds his mace in front of him, no doubt preparing to use it. ""This is the Protectorate! Stop.""

Panda|Ash

Not even bothering to swing a fist, the tinker raises an arm and palm towards the chest and head area of her opponent.

With a grin, she triggers her pulse cannon, despite being uncomfortably within the minimum safe distance.

    ROLL: ""Pulse"" [6] +2 = 8

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Dodge"" [2] +1 = 3

The pulse flares, a brilliant blast of light and sound that makes the empty area feel suddenly very alive. Brutus is thrown backwards and off of his feet, sliding several feet across the sidewalk and green before coming to a stop.

She feels a sudden wrenching in her left arm where Brutus punched her earlier, partially twisting her around. The armor is now dented and twisted, metal digging uncomfortably into the flesh beneath despite precautions to prevent such a thing from occurring.

Brutus bounces back up to his feet. There's a bit of blood visible through the front of his suit, but he doesn't seem concerned by it. ""Alright, alright. Let's go, then.""

Panda|Ash

Akira tries to roll her left arm around to see if anything is broken or bruised, while striding forward quickly.

Can't let that jackass touch me again. Easy.

She stops a yard away and detonates another pulse in his direction.

    ROLL: ""Pulse"" [1] +2 = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Dodge"" [2] +1 = 3

The pulse catches him again, knocking him off his feet and rolling him backwards across the green. He sits up and grimaces before climbing to his feet, with less vigor than before.

The Protectorate heroes are nearly within range. Oz and Playpen.

Oz is a tall man enveloped in a heavy black robe. The hood is deep and unnaturally dark, concealing his face within. It hangs open at the front, revealing a red vest so dark that it might as well be black too. His thin gloves are the same color, but his pants and boots are as black as his robes.

He's holding a mace that is nearly as tall as he is. It is a dull copper color, with a black grip near the middle. The handle ends in a sharp point, while the head ends in several oddly shaped flanges.

Playpen is a fairly normal looking teenage girl. Average height, straight brown hair, brown eyes. She's wearing a floor length black dress with long sleeves, a black choker collar, and black makeup smeared unskillfully around her eyes. She stands behind Oz, looking at the scene before her with interest.

Oz raises his mace, which begins glowing with a bright white light. ""Stop, now.""

Panda|Ash

Akira stops and steps away, hands raised harmlessly above her head. While doing so, she rotates the uncomfortable left shoulder. Fixing that was going to be a pain. Fuck.

""He swung first. Couldn't take what he dished out, it seems,"" she says with a snort of amusement.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [2] +2 = 4

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [2] +1 = 3

Brutus doesn't hesitate, soaring forward and slamming into her, shoulder down. She barely moves from the hit. Oz strides forward, mace leveled at Brutus.

Panda|Ash

""Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch,"" she hisses before lifting her knee as quickly as possible, into the interloper.

    ROLL: ""Ath"" [3] +1 = 4

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [4] +1 = 5

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Dodge"" [5] +1 = 6

She brings her knee up to meet him, but he rolls out of the way. She notices that the place that he hit her armor, square in the torso, still feels like there's a force pushing down on it despite his absence-

The force suddenly surges, and she is thrown off of her feet and backwards into the wall. The brick beneath her cracks, and she rattles inside of her armor.

    ROLL: ""Oz Attack"" [5] +2 = 7

    ROLL: ""Brutal Dodge"" [5] +1 = 6

Now that the pair are separated, Oz's mace flares to life, firing a blinding blast of light towards Brutus. Brutus dives to the side again, but the blast finds him nonetheless, slamming him onto the ground.

""Stay down,"" Oz says, keeping his weapon trained on him, but his hood is turned towards Akira.

Panda|Ash

Akira growls, stepping forward and rolling various joints, hands still held at head-height. She starts examining what she could of her armor, which arguably was vastly more important than whatever was going on with the tin...ker...

Her head snaps up abruptly with a manic gleam in her eye.

Hungrily, she observes everything about the tinker. His body language, his 'robes'- were they tinkertech too? very convincing- and most importantly, his mace.

She was planning on going to talk to them anyway... maybe she could figure out a way to exchange some tech. Hmm... something without collateral damage as a rule would be appreciated.

Teller|GM

A vision flashes through her mind, drawing on future possibilities and what she knows of Oz. She's hurling everything she has at Oz, driving him backwards. He retaliates with blinding blasts of various colors, but she's winning, forcing him to summon a hardlight shield to defend himself and his Ward...

Now she sees herself with the same hardlight shield, a protective dome projected from a orb embedded in the chest of her armor...

The vision vanishes. Brutus is climbing to his feet, seemingly much less battered by the attacks than he should be. His gaze flickers between Oz and Akira, fists clenched.

Panda|Ash

""Never anyone I want to take on, huh?"" She mutters to herself. Giving a quick assessment of her situation- moderately damaged armor, full charges for the Singe feature, only one left for the Pulse feature, and facing an unknown Tinker allied to the Protectorate- she quickly shoots down any true thoughts of attacking Oz.

It'd draw too much of the wrong kind of attention on her head and push her goals back even further. No. She'd figure something else out.

Her hands stay where they are, even as she eyes Brutus and Oz warily, prepared to fight if necessary. Always ready to fight, she was. Probably why ma hated her so much. Whatever.

Teller|GM

""You both,"" Oz says slowly. ""Are accompanying me to the PRT HQ for questioning. Keep your hands where I can see them.""

Brutus doesn't move, keeping his hands clenched. He doesn't look like he has any intention of going to the PRT HQ tonight.

Panda|Ash

""Yo, do you even have the authority to tell either of us to do anything?"" Akira quirks an eyebrow, still feeling confrontational, ""Let's be honest, we didn't destroy any property, didn't harm any civilians, didn't do anything illegal. As far as you know, we were showing off for our friends. You'll need something better than 'you're coming with us', we all know it.""

Teller|GM

""You-"" Oz gestures to Akira with his free hand ""-held two civilians hostage. He attacked you, as you claimed earlier, AND he damaged the wall of the building behind you.""

His voice deep and brooks no nonsense. ""So, again, you both are coming with me.""

A few feet behind him, Playpen cracks her knuckles.

Panda|Ash

""Well yeah, he did all of that. He's kind of a little shit. But I didn't hold anyone hostage, that's some cliche supervillain shit, and I've been in broad daylight on a college campus. Try again,"" she lays eyes on the girl next to the tinker, ""Calm down there, shortstack. You don't want this. I fight little people.""

Teller|GM

Playpen opens her mouth to respond, but Oz cuts her off. ""Playpen, do not engage.""

He seems annoyed by Akira's comments directed at Playpen. ""Quiet. You can explain it at the HQ.""

Brutus stretches, and then without warning shoots into the air.

    ROLL: ""Brutal’s Speed"" [3] +1 = 4

    ROLL: ""Oz’s Reaction"" [5] +1 = 6

Oz slams his mace into the ground, and the hardlight dome that she envisioned earlier blossoms forth. Brutus is fast, flying straight up, but the dome is faster. It forms a curved, pink ceiling above them all, the edges of the dome intersecting with the walls and building and the ground at odd angles to enclose them.

""Fuck,"" Brutus snarls. He hovers near the top of the dome, turning his head and right.

Panda|Ash

""So, I'm curious,"" Akira decides to fold her arms instead of holding them up for an excessively long amount of time, ""Why did the Protectorate send the posterchild for ""Most Likely To Start An Unnecessary Fight"" to handle this situation? 'Quiet', really? Already had plans to talk to Plum Parakeet later today, but you're making me inclined to help Bruticus over there break out. How about you let the munchkin talk instead of you? She might have a higher charisma stat.""

Teller|GM

""It's Brutal,"" Brutus - er, Brutal, apparently - snaps. He flies over to the wall of the building and begins pummeling the bricks with his bare hands, hitting the same spot over and over.

""And it's Purple Parrot,"" Playpen sighs, with far more attitude than should fit in a person of her size.

Oz removes something from inside of his sleeve and hurls it at the ground. There's a brilliant flash of red, and then the area is bathed in a flickering red light.

    ROLL: ""Akira’s Guts"" [6] = 6

    ROLL: ""Brutal’s Guts"" [1] +1 = 2

Akira feels a red haze reach for the edges of her mind, but she pushes it away without much difficulty. Brutal, however, begins looking around wildly, looking confused and lost.

Panda|Ash

""Okay, Toto,"" the Tinker growls, ""Next indiscriminate attack on my person while I'm comfortably over here not fighting will be answered. Apologize, now.""

Teller|GM

""I'm sorry,"" Oz says, the apology coming with surprising ease. The area is still bathed in the flickering red light, but it only seems to be affecting Brutal. ""That wasn't intended for you. That should keep him until transport arrives.""

""Can I take this to mean that you're coming quietly? If you really haven't done anything wrong, you'll be cleared and released, and I'll personally apologize to you again.""

Panda|Ash

""I already said I was on my way over. Was going to grab drinks for Le- ahem, Spaceghost Purp. Gonna shoot the shit, she was going to give her recruitment pitch, I was going to decline then ask if I could trade tinkergasms with Oz, the Great and Powerful."" She sniffs, disdainfully. ""I should say no, but yeah, if you're offering a free ride, I'm cool with taking it.""

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [2] +1 = 3

Teller|GM

""Good,"" Oz says, then lapses into silence, turning his hood alternately from Akira to Brutal.

""So, what do you call yourself?"" Playpen asks, taking the silence as her cue to start talking.

Brutal doesn't seem to be recovering. He is flying around near the top of the dome, feeling around for something to hit.

Panda|Ash

Hmm. That was abrupt. Oz obviously has a negative charisma modifier. Poor thing. Someone should touch his butt.

""I usually try not to talk to myself, people get freaked out by that sorta thing. Do you call yourself something? I hear that's not unusual in people under 4 feet.""

Teller|GM

""You know if you don't tell us your name, we get to pick it, right?"" Playpen says. ""Don't worry. If you called yourself something lame, just keep not telling me, and I'll think of something cool for you later.""

She gives Akira an exaggerated smile. Oz looks at Playpen, but doesn't intervene.

Panda|Ash

""Isn't your name like Babybop? Abandoned Toy Factory? Stands-On-Stool?"" Akira brings a hand to her chin as if she's deep in thought, ""No matter, I'm certain that you couldn't come up with something better. Ashcloud Akira, at your service. Somewhat unwillingly, but we'll chalk this up to first-encounter awkwardness and try first impressions again next time.""

She eyes Brutal, buzzing around like a crippled fly.

""Except for him. That motherf..ather,"" she catches herself at the last moment, as if just now realizing a child was around to hear any swearing.

Teller|GM

""That's a dumb motherfucking name,"" Playpen says, enunciating the cuss word like a fine morsel she's savoring.

""Language, Playpen,"" Oz says lightly.

Brutal seems to finally right himself, and stops flying around the top of the dome. Outside of the dome, a PRT van is pulling up.

""Fuck,"" Brutal swears. He makes another pair of fists, but doesn't move to attack anyone.

Panda|Ash

""Yep. You definitely should've been the one talking from the start. You've got spunk, kid. And snot and shit on your face, but I guess you walked by yourself today so at least you get one gold star.""

Akira eyes Brutal before turning to Oz lazily, ""If I brought my own aux cord, can I handle the music? How else can I earn the 'Ashcloud' in my name, if I don't set the whip on fire, right?""

Teller|GM

""Regulations mandate that you ride in back,"" Oz says warily, ""but we'll forego the heavy cuffs and foam.""

He looks up at Brutal. ""Land or be landed, Brutal.""

Brutal grimaces again, but touches down on the ground halfway between Akira and Oz. Playpen, meanwhile, is staring at Akira like she said something horrifying.

""Where?"" she asks, rubbing at her face.

Panda|Ash

Akira pretends as if she's heard nothing and goes to get in the van, closest to the front as she can get, looking for a place where the aux cord can be plugged in at.

""Where is the auxiliary port, guys! Otherwise this road trip is going to be boriiiing.""

Teller|GM

Oz lowers his dome as she approaches the edges of the field. When she approaches the front of the van, a PRT squad member steps out and points a foam launcher at her warningly. Song. She's heard a lot about him since coming to Sicol Bend, even more than she's heard about the heroes.

""I like boring,"" he says. ""See enough excitement, you realize it's overrated. So I'm hoping this is a boring ride for both of us. In the back, please.""

PRT squad members move to contain Brutal, securing handcuffs around his wrist while Oz keeps his mace leveled at him. Playpen wanders after Akira, still rubbing at her face with vigor.

Panda|Ash

""Easy there, tiger. Can't be this rough with me in front of kids. Later, maybe."" With a two fingered salute, Akira goes and gets in the back of the van and settled in. Maybe a nap would work.

Teller|GM

Brutal is loaded into the back of the van. Surprisingly, it's not Oz who sits in the back with them, but Playpen and a squad member. She looks between the pissed off Brutal and Akira, then at the squad member.

""Okay, like, seriously. Is there something on my face?"" she asks, as the vehicle begins moving.

""Just makeup,"" the squad member says. Playpen stops rubbing at her face and glares at Akira.

""Not funny,"" she says.

Panda|Ash

""Nope. But watching you smear your makeup across your face like a mad child was hilarious. Thanks for the show, kid!""

She turns to the squad member. ""What's your name? Or codename or whatever, I'm Akira, pleased to meet you.""

Teller|GM

""Emerson,"" the man says simply. Playpen is silent, but the look that she's giving her is legitimately chilling. Her expression is that of a person who is actively planning how Akira is going to die.

Panda|Ash

""What's your story, Emerson? I mean, I'm trying to imagine how badass you'd have to be to take this job. Me? I'm a tinker. I can build something for almost anything. The tyke over here can whine anything into submission, or pout at it, or throw toys until she gets her way, I dunno. But you, you're special."" Akira leans back, thinking about how her own gang had just her as a cape, yet they were effective in ways she continued to be proud of. ""Standing against would-be gods as a man is worthy of praise, whether we like each other personally or not. You're a hero.""

Teller|GM

""Thank you. But I can't talk to you too much, sorry,"" Emerson says, apologetically. Playpen continues to silently glare death at her.

Panda|Ash

""No sweat, just showin' appreciation."" Satisfied, the tinker leans back, hands propped up behind her head, and tries to doze off.

"
"Teller|GM

Ashcloud Akira sits in a PRT interrogation room.

It is not a welcoming room. It is cramped and humid. The walls are a lackluster gray, and the floor is a slightly different color of gray. The room's only pieces of furniture are a metal table and two chairs set across from each other. A gray light shines down from a circular lamp set into the ceiling.

In short, whoever designed this room was really fucking into the color gray.

PRT officer Song sits down in the chair opposite from her, a folder in his hands. Oz stands next to him.

""Hi,"" Song says.

Panda|Ash

""Hi,"" Akira says, absently sketching outlines for additions to her suit with her finger and the table. She found that it helped her retain details if she faux-drew things. Or maybe she was full of it. Who knows.

Teller|GM

Song waits a beat for her to continue, then sighs and leans forward. ""So, I showed up at the end of the story. Want to tell me what happened?""

Panda|Ash

""Dunno, big man next to you seems convinced that I was the boogeyman."" She looks up finally, a hint of laughter on her voice. ""Is this one of those 'foregone conclusions' type situations, where no matter what I say, I'll end up getting locked up? I mean, this room isn't terribly inviting to anyone who isn't over 70.""

    ROLL: ""Guts - Light Resist"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

""Yeah. Basically,"" Song says, with a shrug. ""Unless you've got something to say to convince us you're not in the wrong, here, but I'm not holding my breath.""

The room isn't terribly inviting, but she feels relatively at ease here, and the situation doesn't read as stressful as it otherwise might have. Not that she would have stressed anyway.

Panda|Ash

""Seems a bit ignorant, if you ask me. What happened to 'innocent until proven guilty'?"" Ash sighs and leans back in her chair, rolling her shoulders.

""Anywho, the situation is simple: I showed up on campus, spoke to some kids about getting in contact with a Whirlwind connect, spoke to Bruticus, then retaliated when he threw the first blow. The Wizard was there for that part. All collateral damage was a result of me defending myself. And on two occasions, me not defending myself,"" she turns her helm towards the Tinker, hinting heavily towards the cheap shots she suffered from both Brutus and the Wiz.

Teller|GM

""We heard different from the kid,"" Song says. Oz shifts slightly. ""Says you threatened him. Were counting at him.""

Panda|Ash

Akira snorts and has to force down laughter.

""Do you hear yourself? Does Sesame Street terrify you in the middle of the night too?""

She coughs a few times to get herself under control.

""Anywho, did the kid mention that I did nothing more than count at him after he attacked me while my attention was diverted elsewhere? I noticed that wasn't mentioned. What else did he forget to say, I wonder...""

Teller|GM

Song sighs again. ""You're walking around in a human-shaped tank. Didn't Parrot mention something to you about conducting yourself with a little finesse?""

""You think this is funny, but I've got better things to do than quibble about what constitutes a threat. Your presence constitutes a threat, even if you hadn't counted and mentioned blowing up buildings.""

Song starts to continue, and then sighs again and waits for a response.

Panda|Ash

The Tinker nods and leans forward, trying to wrangle forth some fucks to provide this obviously stressed individual.

""Well...""

She taps her finger on the table as she draws a blank on the forthcoming fucks. Alas. She shrugs and plows onward.

""One (oh noes, she's counting again), I'm in a human-shaped tank. I couldn't do finesse if I wanted to. Two (oh no, the horror), if we're going to do the whole 'you being present is a threat therefore you're guilty' bullshit, then you might as well try to arrest me now. Three (oh the agony, make it stop), if you're going to unilaterally ignore what I'm actually saying in order to bulldoze through to prove your own points, bring in your Director or I'm leaving.""

Teller|GM

Song carefully refrains from sighing.

""I have a finite number of fucks per day to give over here,"" he says, unintentionally echoing her thoughts. ""Every bullshit answer you give me, where you pretend like you don't know you were threatening those kids, uses one of them up.""

""And I'm happy to use them up. It's my job to give a fuck, as long as this is going somewhere. So give me something.""

""What were you hoping to accomplish, starting something like this? Contacting Whirlwind? Parrot was all ready to talk to you, give you this-"" he taps the folder ""-information on the Yellowjackets, offer to help. What happened?""

Panda|Ash

""How ironic. We both seem to have a limited tolerance for bullshit. Can't wait to see what happens when we both run out,"" Ash utters, deadpan.

""I don't trust information that's freely given, especially not by the Protectorate. Everyone has an agenda and I don't trust yours."" The young woman gestures around at the room before gesturing at the two individuals across from her. ""I'm seeing nothing worth that trust so far. I've been stalked by one of you, attacked when unprovoked by another- hi Wiz, don't think I forgot - and the last seems to have his head lodged firmly up his ass.""

She lets out an exaggerated sigh, mimicking the officer seated in front of her.

Teller|GM

""It wouldn't have been freely given,"" Song says. ""Would've come with the opportunity to lecture you about not pulling this sort of shit, and making sure you turned to us for support instead of trying to connect with villains like Whirlwind.""

""In the grand scheme of things, you haven't done anything really wrong. We'd like to keep it that way, and the easiest way to do that is to offer you an avenue to getting what you want above the table.""

Song pauses, gestures to the folder on the table but doesn't offer it to her. ""I take it this folder isn't an end for you, is it? It's a means.""

Panda|Ash

Her helm tilts to the side as Ash peers keenly at Song. She was getting the impression that he was intentionally riling her up to get info out of her. Smart cookie. It probably started when he wouldn't let her use the auxiliary port. Asshole.

""I made promises to find out what happened. Going to you gets me part of the story. Going to you also cuts off... less savory avenues."" The words leave her mouth feeling thick and ugly, as if she was betraying her friends by sharing even this much.

Teller|GM

Song doesn't say anything, probably expecting her to continue. Oz remains as silent as he has been over the course of the discussion.

Panda|Ash

""Fine. Whirlwind was a means to an end. Hopefully a quick and easy end. Get in contact with the-"" she gestures vaguely, ""-kids playing at running a gang, scare them into telling me what happened, and if it's not enough information, using them to find other sources who could get it to me. If they knew enough, I left and only caused a barest ripple in this town so I could be on my way.""

She stretches, groaning a bit while she's at it.

""Obviously things didn't go that way. Brutney was kind of a dick.""

Teller|GM

A notification that only she can hear beeps on her suit. One of her trackers has just entered her range? She doesn't have a proper HUD, but a small digital readout across the bridge of her nose indicates that it's ninety-eight feet South-West and approaching.

""Whirlwind's all like that. They're brats,"" Song says. He picks up the folder. ""I wouldn't expect them to know anything about anything. Any chance of you telling me why you want to find out what happened?""

Panda|Ash

""They were friends."" She bites out tersely, as politely a way as possible to let him know not to start shit on this topic.

    ROLL: ""Social"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

""Hm,"" Song says, but doesn't press it. ""Anyway, you're cooling your heels in a cell for the day, because - and I want to stress this - threatening civilians is a dumb idea.""

""Information on the Yellowjackets...I wouldn't say it's off the table, but you haven't endeared yourself to the Director.""

A half-smile pulls at the edges of his lips, but he forces it down. ""I don't know if Parrot will want that dance, either. You might've missed your window.""

Panda|Ash

""No I'm not. Because- and I want to stress this- you can't prove I threatened anyone and I don't like your attitude. Also because you didn't ask. Do they not have anyone personable at this damn building?""

She leans back in her chair and sighs.

""I really wanted that dance too. Damn.""

Teller|GM

The tracker is now fifty feet away, more south than west now, and appears to have stopped moving. Song sighs and stands up, lifting the folder as he does so.

""Not my call, and not really up for debate,"" he says. ""By, 'not really', I mean you could debate it, but you wouldn't be winning that argument.""

Oz visibly shifts again, tightening his grip on his mace. A brief vision of a dampening field generator flits through her mind, a pulsing spherical region around her that nullifies energy attacks...

The vision vanishes as soon as it arrives. She's not even wholly sure what that field has to do with Oz, but it sure looked useful.

Panda|Ash

Ash takes a deep breath through her nose, holds it for a few seconds, then releases it slowly through her mouth.

~Yeah, I get it... I'd prefer to try at least one more time. Then I might not have a choice...~

""Okay. One final time. I'm going to try this once again,"" the Tinker is mildly surprised that she's not more upset rather than mildly annoyed, but whatever.

""I went to the campus. I found a girl to speak with. While I was talking to her, some kid jumped me from behind. In retaliation I... did absolutely nothing besides help him up. Afterwards, I asked for information and continued to do nothing more threatening than count in their presence. I won't bother trying to explain myself again, if you're going to keep ignoring shit I'm saying.""

Teller|GM

""Right,"" Song says flatly. He looks annoyed. ""I'll play along. What were you counting for?""

Panda|Ash

""Because I am a Tinker in public. I don't have time to wait around while more kids gather the courage to jump on me,"" Ash says just as flatly. ""Or maybe the capes that killed my friends might've shown up while I was standing around waiting. Or any number of things. This should be self explanatory.""

Teller|GM

""Mhm,"" Song says. He looks at Oz.

""Finished?"" Oz asks.

""Yeah,"" Song says. He pushes the chair back under the table.

Panda|Ash

Ashcloud Akira, vaguely irritated Tinker, stands slowly, hands placed flat against the table.

""I guess that's that, then,"" she mutters softly.

Teller|GM

""You need to come with me for processing, please,"" Oz says. Song opens the door, and steps out into the hallway.

Her tracker starts moving again. It's coming closer...forty feet...thirty...

Panda|Ash

""Sure thing."" She follows meekly, hands at her side and head hanging slightly.

Teller|GM

Song shoots her a look full of suspicion, but doesn't say anything as Oz leads her into the hallway. He walks a step behind her and slightly to her left. The hallways are nice, if a little cramped and outdated: wood-paneled, and thick windows looking out over the sea every few feet.

They're headed away from the tracker, unfortunately. The distance slowly stops decreasing, then begins growing.

Panda|Ash

""How long will this walk be?"" Ash inquires exhaustedly, half turning to Song and palming her hands behind her back.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [4] = 4

Teller|GM

""Not long,"" Song says, sticking his own hands through the loops of his pants. As if it's some sort of signal, Oz shifts his grip on his mace. ""Look, you know and I know what you're thinking. Don't try anything cute. We'll all get to have a nice, quiet end to our day.""

He sounds weary, like he's said the words a million times to a million different people, and exactly zero of them have listened.

Panda|Ash

""Sounds ideal,"" she spits, bitterly.

Then she changes the setting on her Pulse weaponry to overdrive and lets it loose in between the wood and the window slightly in front of her.

    ROLL: ""Pulse"" [2] +4 = 6

Teller|GM

The wall in front of her explodes outwards. The wood paneling overlays a thick metal wall, but even that yields to her blast, send splinters of metal flying. Most of the material is propelled outwards by the attack, but some of it deflects inwards, pelting Oz and Song with debris.

There's a large hole in the wall - not quite as large as she would have liked, but she could force herself through it with some effort.

""Motherfuck,"" Song says, drawing his gun without hesitation and firing at Ash.

    ROLL: ""Song’s Attack"" [5] (2) +1 = 6

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [6] +2 = 8

The bullet pings off of the suit - she's not sure where it goes, but it's not in her, and that's what counts. Oz reacts with less speed than Song, but still moves quickly, slamming his mace onto the ground. A flickering pink dome forms around them, similar to the one that prevented Brutal from escaping earlier.

""Tinker sub Blaster 6 attempting to escape from custody, Section A3, all hands,"" Oz says. Then, addressing Ash, he barks. ""Mistake. Stand down.""

Panda|Ash

Utterly ignoring the words coming from his mouth, Ash gleefully turns to the Tinker and mutters, ""Here you go, you greedy little fucker, now I have justification.""

Then she blesses him with her final overclocked Pulse burst.

    ROLL: ""Pulse"" [6] +4 = 10

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Oz's Dodge"" [1] +1 = 2

The brilliant pulse sends Oz flying backwards, knocking the mace from his hand - no, breaking his mace. He tumbles backwards and crashes into his fading dome. He doesn't groan or move; he simply bleeds.

    ROLL: ""Song’s Attack"" [1] (1) +1 = 2

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [5] +2 = 7

""Mother. Fuck,"" Song repeats, and shoots at Ash again while moving backwards. The bullet bounces off harmlessly. ""Fuck.""

Panda|Ash

""Next time I hear you shoot at me, I will return the favor."" Ashcloud Akira, flushed with victory, fires off a single Singe projectile into the empty space between herself and Song before moving towards the open hole in the hallway, calling out to the lone gunman, ""And that is not a threat, it's a promise.""

Teller|GM

The hallway between her and the PRT officer bursts into flame. He doesn't do anything as she moves to the hole in the wall, except glance at his fallen companion.

""Alright,"" he says quietly, biting back the anger from his voice.

Panda|Ash

She takes a deep, shuddering breath before proceeding to kick the edges of the hole until she could fit through it.

Amused, she calls out once more, ""And when you relay this to the Director, tell him to invest in people who won't piss off unknown capes. Seems smart to me!""

Teller|GM

She kicks at the ragged edges of the hole, widening the gap as shards of fake wood and metal give way to mechanized boot.

""You know, if you try to go out that way, they're just going to activate the building's lightshield,"" Song calls, continuing to back away. ""You'll be trapped."""
"Panda|Ash

""Maybe I'll drag Ozzy with me too, make sure they let me out lest I try to use him as a battering ram. How effective do you think that'll be, I'm curious?""

She stops kicking and starts using her raw strength to shove the edges to the side and open it up enough for her to fit through easily.

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Song’s Attack"" [6] (6) +1 = 7

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [1] +2 = 3

The opening is now wide enough for her to fit through, but the gunshot rings out before she can leave. This one doesn't ricochet, and instead strikes her directly in the head.

It's her that armor saves her life. Her head rattles inside of the helm, but instead of dying from a headshot, she finds that her ears are ringing and she can't see out of her visor. Is it her visor, or her eyes? Damn.

""Wouldn't work,"" she hears Song call out over the ringing. ""And besides, you can't leave yet. You promised me something.""

Panda|Ash

Disoriented, frustrated, and high off of adrenaline as she is, Cameron - the woman, not the villain - can tell when she's being taunted.

Fuck that.

Immediately, she throws herself out of the hole into a freefall before ripping off her helm and activating her flight functionality.

Teller|GM

She tears the helm free of her her head, but it doesn't restore her vision. She can, however, feel the contrast between the wind on her uncovered face, and spots on her face where blood is running down and blocking her sight.

Her flight kicks into gear after a fraction of a second, slowing and then stopping her descent. She has five minutes of air time, give or take, not counting the time she'd have if she overclocks it.

She's not sure that overclocking a function of her core frame is the best idea right now, but then, this is not the best situation.

Panda|Ash

Fuck it.

She needs to get far away from the Protectorate and that takes priority. So, with no better options left to her, she flies straight ahead; trusting in the lack of buildings that high was an extreme (heh) leap of faith, but she had nothing better to go on for the moment.

In the meantime she prods near one of her eyes to try to figure out what was going on. Not that she was a nurse or these were ideal circumstances, by any means.

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [4] = 4

    ROLL: ""Wits"" [1] = 1

Teller|GM

She slaps headlong into a solid, smooth barrier. She can tell from the pain that her head is bleeding, and her eyes are fine aside from having blood in it. As she forces one eye open, she sees that she's pressed up against a bright gray barrier of light, a supersized version of Oz's dome. It encircles the entire Protectorate base, as far as she can tell - no doubt normally intended to keep attacking forces out, the giant barrier is sealing her inside.

Panda|Ash

""Yes, I know that was dumb. But oh my motherfuck does it hurt.""

After getting her instinctive hissing out of the way, she immediately reconsiders what she's going to do.

Can't go through the wall, it was undoubtedly strong enough to tank anything she could dish. (For now, at least). Have to wait until they drop it. So...

She gingerly aims herself for the base of the forcefield, assuming it's a globe, while activating her stealth feature.

Teller|GM

She shoots towards the base of the shield. Now that her vision is clearer, she sees that it intersects the land on one side and passes into the water on the other. Far behind her, some large, flapping bat-thing emerges from the hole in the PRT HQ, but it doesn't look like it sees her. Her armor has taken on the color of the grey field behind her, as well as the barely visible vagaries of the landscape behind it. The cloaking isn't perfect, but it's enough to stop her from being instantly spotted.

Panda|Ash

~Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitsh~

She continues aiming for the absolute bottom of the forcefield, deigning to place her helm back on finally.

Teller|GM

She plunges into the water, creating a splash that's sure to draw attention, but she's gone from the area of the disturbance before they can do anything about it.

Her suit wasn't designed to be airtight, but even damaged it's doing a better than expected job at keeping out the seawater. She feels the cold liquid seeping in around the damaged arm of the suit, and there's a growing wetness at the base of her neck she could do without, but she has a few minutes of air to spend down here. She floats next to the shining gray forcefield bottom, drifting gently in place. It's eerily quiet down here, in contrast to the chaos that must be going on above.

It will buy her time to think, if nothing else.

Panda|Ash

Alright, time to think this through.

If I was a giant demonic bat thing, what would I most dislike happening to me?

Hmmmm. Have we ever seen it being ridden into battle like a glorious st- OH MY GOODNESS, YES!

Plan confirmed for best plan ever, Ash maintains her stealth field while slowly flying up the side of the barrier, looking around for her- soon to be- new best friend.

    ROLL: ""Stealth"" [4] +3 = 7

Teller|GM

She slips out of the water as stealthily as she can. Drops of liquid fall out of her suit, forming a telltale pattern on the water below her, but slows and stops as her armor empties out.

Near the absolute top of the hardlight barrier is the demonic, horned bat thing she saw earlier, drifting in a lazy circle. She judges that it's half her height, maybe smaller.

Panda|Ash

Taking a few shuddering breaths to calm her excited nerves, and to try to ignore the chill in her arm, Ash floats upward for a few moments before bracing herself mentally.

Then she shoots forward, aiming to catch the creature off guard by shoving its face into the 'ceiling'. Because why the hell not.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [3] +1 = 4

    ROLL: ""Guts - Aura Resist"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Bat’s Brawn"" [5] +1 = 6

She shoots forward and grasps at the creature. As soon as her metal-clad fingers brush up against it, it begins flapping madly, batting at her with its wings. Her tenuous grasp is broken, and she rockets past, narrowly avoiding hitting the ceiling herself.

Ash feels a sort of weariness falling over her, a sense of emptiness sinking into her mind and bones. She can tell it's not a natural feeling, but that doesn't help her shake free of it. At least it doesn't seem to have taken full hold of her yet.

The demon bat folds its wings and plummets downward, a barely controlled fall towards the PRT HQ below.

Panda|Ash

""WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!""

Ashcloud Akira, smartest person she knows, follows the stupid fucking thing as fast as possible, after firing a single Singe grenade in an attempt to wing the beast.

    ROLL: ""Singe"" [6] +3 = 9

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Bat’s Dodge"" [3] +2 = 5

    ROLL: ""Bat’s Guts"" [3] = 3

The projectile strikes home, and now the creature truly looks likes it came from the depths of hell. Its back and wings now burning, the creature careens off course briefly, then course corrects. The damn thing’s not even making any noise, just flapping its burning wings without complaint. It's making a beeline for the hole in the wall that she made earlier.

The weariness settles in, making itself at home in her mind and her muscles. It's hard to feel optimistic about her current course of action, but it's not like any of the alternatives look much better.

She doesn't feel like saying ""whee"" again, that's for sure. A part of her isn't sure she'll ever ""whee"" again.

Panda|Ash

Cameron sighs while diving, and decides to aim for the hole in the wall as well.

""Fuck it, might as well.""

    ROLL: ""Wits - Spot"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Athletics"" [6] +1 = 7

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Bat’s Athletics"" [5] +1 = 6

The pair of them rocket towards the hole in the wall. Some smoke is still wafting out of it, indicating that they haven't yet put out the fire.

Ash finds herself closing the distance between herself and the demon bat, even as it closes the distance between itself and the hole.

Panda|Ash

Not enough time to come up with a lengthy plan and barely enough to think.

But both times she hit the thing, she felt fatigued.

Entirely possible that there was a correlation there.

She makes sure that she doesn't touch the thing again, but she tosses a tracker at it instead.

    ROLL: ""Dexterity"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Bat’s Athletics"" [3] +1 = 4

The bat narrowly avoids the tracker as it crashlands inside of the HQ, showing little concern for its body as it scrapes the edges of the hole she made and disappears inside, vanishing into the smoke.

Another shape resolves itself in the smoke - a PRT squad member in full riot gear, crouched on their knees and holding a rifle of some kind. She's not sure how she missed them, but here they are.

    ROLL: ""Rifleman’s Attack"" (1) [5] +1 = 6

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [2] +2 = 4

The bullet strikes her in the torso. Her already damaged armor absorbs some of the force of the shot, but not all of it. She feels pain shoot through her ribs.

Panda|Ash

Desperately hoping that she didn't just inherit a scar anywhere sensitive, the rogue Tinker continues her onward charge, aiming directly for the asshole who decided it was a good idea to shoot her.

    ROLL: ""Brawn - Ram"" [3] +2 = 5

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Rifleman’s Guts"" [1] = 1

She slams into him with a satisfying crunching sound, the speed and force of her hit carrying them backwards and into the opposite wall. He hits it with a thud and a groan.

She's back in the burning hallway, where all of this started. Another PRT officer is a few feet to her left, spraying the bat demon down with some bulky, military-grade fire extinguisher backpack thing. Oz and Song are nowhere in sight, but two other officers there, wielding foam launchers and grenades - not good. At least they weren't expecting her assault to take her all the way to the other side of the hall...they whirl, turning the nozzles of the launchers on her.

Panda|Ash

In a fluid movement, she grips the front of the moronic officer's clothing and spins, releasing him in the direction of his comrades.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Officer 1’s Dodge"" [2] -1 = 1

    ROLL: ""Officer 2’s Dodge"" [5] (2) -1 = 4

Ash finds it surprising difficult to lift the PRT officer, even with her armor assisting. Her muscles complain, but she manages to heave the man at his comrades. He lets out a pained yell as he crashes into one of them, knocking them a few steps backwards - buying her time. The other steps smartly to the side, and retaliates by hurling their grenade at Ashcloud.

    ROLL: ""Grenade"" [5] +1 = 6

Panda|Ash

Growing annoyed- not to mention weary- by this ongoing fight, Akira raises her arm and fires one of her own grenades to intercept the incoming one.

    ROLL: ""Singe"" [4] +3 = 7

Teller|GM

She fires her incendiary projectile. Her shot just misses the incoming grenade, flying past to strike the wall and burst into flame, but it seems to have done something - the foam grenade explodes before reaching her. There's an ungodly amount of it, and it flies in all directions, striking all the the squad members, the downed bat, and the front of her suit. She's near the edge of the expanding mess - sticky but not yet stuck.

The space is a mess of fire and foam, but the foam seems to be winning, snuffing out the fire as it expands. At least they won't all burn to death together in this hallway.

Panda|Ash

Ashcloud Akira, arson aficionado, is in a bit of a bind. But it's nothing that she couldn't handle, of course. Just requires a bit of...metaphorical duct tape.

She leaps into the air, angling towards the larger group of squaddies, before activating her flight capabilities.

RAMMING SPEED The Plan: Volume Two is in full effect.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [2] = 2

    ROLL: ""Athletics"" [5] = 5

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Officers’ Reactions"" [4] [5] [1]

The legs of her suit complain as she drags them out of the foam, but they're not coated enough to keep her pinned to the ground. Her flight tech whirs on either side of her, helping to yank her out of the foam with a nasty sucking noise. The she hurtles at the squad members. The two who are on their feet flinch, but react quickly - one goes to their pouch for another grenade, and the other aims their foam launcher at her.

    ROLL: ""Officer 2’s Foam"" [5] -1 = 4

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [6] +1 = 7

She darts left around the stream of foam, leaving it to decorate the ceiling above.

Panda|Ash

Torn between exhaustion and amusement, she tries to pick up speed and slam into the officer with the launcher, to prevent them from getting out another burst.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] +1 = 2

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [3] -1 = 2

She slams into the squad member - not hard enough to knock them backwards, but with enough force to prevent them from launching more foam. He says something that comes out muffled beneath his mask, but it sounds like he's swearing. The other squad member hurls their foam grenade into the air, aiming for the ceiling above them all.

The person struggling with her, the unenthusiastic grenade throwing - the PRT officers look like they're feeling the same weariness that she is.

She hears voices in the hallway behind her, boots against the hard floor. At the same moment, the display in her helm informs her that the first tracker - the one that is or was on Macy - is moving again, small stop-and-start motions within a fixed area.

Panda|Ash

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck this, man. It shouldn't be this hard to drop a few assholes and get on my merry way.

I hate the Protectorate, I swear.

Mental thoughts only somewhat capable of edging out her growing fatigue, the young woman grasps at the foam launcher, intending on wresting it from the officer's grasp and spraying the foam grenade down before it could detonate.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] = 1

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [2] -1 = 1

The officer clings to the launcher as Ash tries to wrench it from his grasp, swearing as he does so. He looks like he's trying to simultaneous keep her from taking the weapon and move away from her. Maybe he saw what she did to Oz. With his legs already partially foamed, he can't manage both, and chooses to keep hanging onto the weapon.

The grenade explodes, dumping copious amounts of foam down upon the four of them. Ash feels the substance weighing down her suit, clinging to the metal and expanding, as if it's actively trying to seep into the joints of her armor. It's flowing over her, threatening to obscure her vision and pin her arms, but most of it is amassing around her legs and waist. Her upper body is still largely free, but the creeping foam promises to make that condition temporary.

Panda|Ash

Fuck.

""Fuck.""

Without any other plan worth mentioning, she pushes off of the officer and attempts to use her flight to give her space from the foam and hopefully reduce the amount on her suit.

Meanwhile, she angles herself towards one of the nearest rooms/cells past the group.

Teller|GM

Her flight tech complains loudly as it strains against the foam. She feels her feet lift off the ground, but that's as far as she gets before the pull of the foam is too much - this time, her suit's not strong enough to lift her clear of the goop.

The officer she was struggling with seems to sink further into the foam, resigned to his fate. The officer she threw is already buried. The third, who threw the grenade, is powering on. They struggle to twist themselves around and direct their launcher at Ash, intent on piling more foam onto her predicament.

Panda|Ash

This is going to suck.

Resigned, Akira puts her flight tech into overdrive and kicks it again.

    ROLL: ""Athletics"" [2] +4 = 6

    ROLL: ""Dexterity - Steering"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

The entire body of her armor shudders and vibrates. She feels herself bouncing off the walls of her suit as her flight tech kicks into overdrive - and then she pulls out of the foam, separating one small mass of foam from the rest. Now she's bouncing off the walls of the hallway, a bundle of machinery and foam, sticking every few feet. She can barely steer, and she can't steer well enough to aim herself at a door - it's a frustrating pattern...stick to a wall, careen a few feet, stick to another wall.

The PRT officer is dragged along in her wake for the first few bounces, then falls off in his own clump of foam and sticks on the floor.

She finds the weariness slowly fading in intensity as she puts distance between herself and the larger mass of foam.

Panda|Ash

With no better plan for the moment than ""hope these are cell rooms while I'm bouncing off of the walls"", Akira decides she might as well ride this out. Oh... And one more thing.

""BRUUUUUUTUUUUUUS, WHERE AAAAARRRREEEE YOUUUUUUUU?!""

Teller|GM

Fly. Smack. Fly. Smack. Her head is starting to hurt from the jolting. But she's approaching a corner, hopefully leading to a door or stairs or something that is a hallway of what seems to be cell doors.

Footsteps. Running...Brutus? No, it's Playpen who turns the corner - or more accurately, skids and trying not to fall over as she takes the turn at full speed. There's another pair of footsteps behind her. There's still a stretch of empty hallway between them, which Playpen begins dashing down, intent on closing the distance. From what she can see out of her visor, Playpen is not pleased.

Panda|Ash

Fuck it.

It's at this point that Akira realizes that she's growing to think like that more and more, and what a way to think.

Maybe the damage that's going onto her poor suit is getting to her.

Abruptly, Akira cuts the flight and attempts to land on her feet, calling out to the girl in the meantime.

""Hey Pintsized, who pissed in your Wheaties?""

Teller|GM

Her flight tech cuts off with a long, low squeal. Ash knows her suit in and out, learned to speak its language and listen when it told her what was going on with it. Right now, a far as she can tell, her suit is cussing at her.

She lands shakily on the ground, assisted in staying upright mostly by the stickiness of the foam on her feet. Playpen curls her hands into fists and keeps coming. Behind her, a different hero rounds the corner - a large man with an ample gut, a black bodysuit, and a collared cape. Wan, Master of the demon bat. He's doing a terrible job of keeping up.

""Playpen, no!"" he pants.

""Playpen yes,"" she snaps back, and continues her charge.
"
"Panda|Ash

Akira's head tilts to the side as her face scrunches up in confusion.

She raises her arm threateningly. ""Who the hell is Playpen? Also, if you keep running, I'll shoot you.""

""Like I care!"" Playpen fires back, and continues running at her undeterred. Wan, however, stops running, leaning against the wall for support. Ash isn't sure, but she doesn't think a Protectorate hero should be this short of breath. Maybe he just got finished fighting Brutus or something.

""No - don't!"" he gasps. He could be speaking to either of them.

Panda|Ash

Amused, but a bit out of breath herself, Akira decides to just bite the metaphorical bullet.

She throws a tracking disc at Playpen's face.

    ROLL: ""Dexterity"" [2] = 2

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Dodge"" [1] +1 = 2

Playpen flinches as the tracking disc hits her face. Her attempt to dodge slows her some, but not enough for Akira to do anything else before the girl plows bodily her, mashing herself into the foam on her lower body like another kid might leap into snow.

Playpen looks up at her, glaring. The lighting around Ashcloud shifts in a very worrying manner, and she feels them both sliding...not backwards, but away. Her tracker readouts, except for the one attached to Playpen, are going haywire - reporting zero distance, then distances of miles, then...

Panda|Ash

Can I punch her in the face?

""I'm going to punch you in the face.""

She punches the child in the face.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [6] +1 = 7

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [2] = 2

There's a cracking noise as metal collides with young flesh and bone - the girl's nose is definitely broken, and there are red marks where the knuckles of her gauntlet hit other parts of her face.

Disturbingly, the girl lets out of cry of pain that slowly turns into a laugh. A forced laugh, but still a laugh.

They're no longer in the hallway. They seem to be...inside of a dimly lit, dusty attic, next to a stack of old boxes. The only real light is from a slit between the boards of one wall.

The light is purple. This is not okay.

And now Playpen is sinking into the foam like it's so much water, vanishing somewhere between her legs. The foam is briefly illuminated with purple light.

This is not okay.

Panda|Ash

""This is not okay!""

Somewhat freaking out - understandably so - finds the Tinker grasping one of Playpen's arms and aiming to haul her 'out', bodily.

Where is she even going?! This is a disgusting power and she should be ashamed!

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] +1 = 2

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Brawn"" [1] -1 = 0

She grabs onto Playpen's arm and begins dragging her back out of the foam. She's only partway out when the foam seems to resolidfy with respect to Playpen, grasping tightly onto the Ward. Half of her face is visible, and it's glaring at Ashcloud.

The room is shifting around them. The walls are cracking, falling apart, plaster dust and insulation floating to the ground. Through the cracks she can see blackness, tinged only with streaks of purple energy.

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [2] = 2

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [4] = 4

The floor is shifting as well. A crack forms, and a tendril of purple energy shoots past her, narrowly missing both of them.

""Like it?"" Playpen asks, with false cheer in her voice. Her voice sounds stuffy. ""You're in my house, now.""

She sounds far too cocky for someone with a broken nose.

Panda|Ash

""Shut up,"" she says with only the barest smidgen of concern before shoving a few of her fingers down the girl's throat and leaving them there. ""Let me out.""

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [5] +1 = 6

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [2] = 2

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [6] = 6

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [3] +1 = 4

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [5] = 5

Playpen makes a choking noise as the metal fingers are crammed into her throat, and struggles against her. Two more tendrils of energy shoot past them, and Ash just manages to twist her upper body around enough to dodge them.

Playpen flails, and tries to unsuccessfully to remove the gauntlet from her mouth. A purple tendril strikes the Ward, and and the girl spasms. For a moment Ash thinks she sees...but no, the flicker is over, and she's Playpen again.

Panda|Ash

The Tinker gives a resigned sigh as she refuses to remove her hand. In fact, she adjusts her grip so her fingers are even further in the girl's mouth.

""When you're ready to get us out of here, I'm ready to move my hand. If I get hit, you get hit. I'm settling in for a long, stubborn wait.""

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [2] +1 = 3

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [5] = 5

    ROLL: ""Energy Tendril"" [6] +2 = 8

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Dodge"" [6] = 6

Playpen makes a gurgling noise, like she's trying to speak, still tugging weakly at the metal gauntlet wedged inside her mouth.

The walls of the room seem to have stabilized in their current cracked form. Three tendrils of purple of energy shoot through the gaps between the old boards, this time too many for her to dodge. Two of them strike her, and she feels - nothing at first, and then an odd wetness over her entire body.

Her suit is melting.

Liquid metal and plastic, room temperature, flowing off of her. Her clothes are liquid too, mixing with the liquid of the suit. Her helm is filling her mouth, and now she's the one choking...

Panda|Ash

No no no no no no.

This is an illusion of some sort, has to be.

But it feels real, and that's what matters, supposedly.

Head tilted downwards means the ""liquid"" flows away from the mouth, fingers still firmly shoved in the girl's mouth means that I obviously don't give a fuck about what she has to say, and ignoring the encroaching despair about my suit. Yes. I got this.

The panicked and furious woman tries her best to pay her situation no mind, while relentlessly continuing her transgressions against the teenager. One of them had to break first. If it wasn't the teenager, then Akira would eat her helm.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [3] = 3

Teller|GM

Pain shoots through her hand as teeth close onto her now unarmored flesh. She's momentarily blinded as the liquid metal flows over her face, but she's avoided breathing it in, thankfully. If it was even real.

The liquid metal, plastic, and cloth flows off of her, leaving Ash exposed and unarmed. It's condensing into an object between them, and it looks sharp. The melted metal of her glove, mingled with possibly vomit, flows down Playpen's chin.

Panda|Ash

She closes her eyes, takes in a sharp, angry breath, and punches the child in the side of the head with her left hand while forcefully shoving her right hand wholesale into the girl's mouth.

""Let. Me. Go.""

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [4] -1 = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Guts"" [6] = 6

She strikes the girl in the side of the head, hard, but it doesn't seem to deter whatever the hell this girl or this place is doing. She is clearly vomiting now, a nasty mix of  stomach juice and whatever the ward had for breakfast washing over her hand.

There is also now a large, sharp piece of material, mostly metal, juxtaposed between them, pushing forcefully against her belly. It's obviously attempting to make her let go of Playpen - she'll be skewered if she doesn't move backwards, but it probably doesn't have nice plans for her if she does, either.

Panda|Ash

""If I get stabbed by this stupid thing, I'll shove my fucking thumbs into your eyes, I do so swear,"" the pissed off woman growls down at her pitiful foe.

""We'll stay in here together and suffer for as long as necessary until you let me go.""

This time, instead of another punch, she uses her free hand to close Playpen's nose- at least as much of it as she can reach- and twist it all at the same time.

No mercy for those who would show none.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] -1 = 0

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Brawn"" [1] -1 = 0

Ashcloud and Playpen struggle with each other, with Ashcloud failing to pinch the girl's nose shut, and Playpen failing to remove the hand in her mouth.

    ROLL: ""Metal Spike"" [1] +3 = 4

    ROLL: ""Ashcolud’s Guts"" [5] = 5

Ash feels a great deal of pain in her abdomen as the metal pierces it, twisting cruelly as it does so. It's one of the worst things she's felt in her life - but she tenaciously clings on to her wits and Playpen.

Panda|Ash

""You obviously,"" she punches the girl in the side of the head, ""thought I was joking,"" another blow, ""about fighting little people,"" and yet another.

At this point, pushing through the discomfort and fatigue and pain is almost entirely due to sheer overwhelming rage.

How fucking dare this little shit ruin that beautiful suit!

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [4] -1 = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Guts"" [6] = 6

Ash strikes her in the head, and tears fill her eyes, but the little Ward seems determined to see this through.

Another purple tendril snakes out, touching Playpen. Her face shifts again, into the same shape she thought she glimpsed earlier through her ruined helm - a disfigured, horrific looking thing. Then another tendril reaches out and causes Playpen's dress to crawl over her, mixing with the fabric from Ash's clothes to form a dark robe that obscures her features. It's strikingly similar to the one Oz wears.

The metal structure shifts, trying to drive Ash backwards again, this time with brute force instead of the threat of damage.

    ROLL: ""Metal Spike"" [4] +1 = 5

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Brawn"" [3] -1 = 2

The pain her stomach is nearly unbearable as she's pushed away like a speared beast, sliding away from her opponent. It doesn't seem to do any more damage, thankfully, but the current amount is more than enough to be concerning.

Playpen is still vomiting, barely aware and flailing at someone who's not there.

Panda|Ash

Hatehatehatehatehate hate this little girl.

Cameron coughs a bit from the pain before channeling her rage into something productive.

She moves forward and throws a punch at Playpen's face.

    ROLL: ""Athletics"" [6] -1 = 5

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [4] -1 = 3

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Guts"" [5] = 5

The floor is rumbling, shaking beneath her, the floorboards wobbling like they're set on jello instead of crossbeams. Boxes hurl themselves into her path, stretching out to grab at her feet and ankles - the room is trying to keep her away. She stumbles and leaps past the obstacles, managing to keep her footing long enough to make it over to the ward and punch her in the face.

She pauses hacking and coughing long enough to half-block, but the punch still connects. Still, she doesn't go down.

Playpen lets out an unintelligible, frustrated scream. Two floorboards peels themselves from the floor, and one swings itself at Ash.

    ROLL: ""Board"" [2] = 2

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [4] = 4

She brings her hands up to her face to block the board, pushing through the pain.

Panda|Ash

""Thank you,"" Cam growls before snatching the board up and moving forward again.

""FOOOORE!""

She swings the board at the girl's head as hard as possible.

    ROLL: ""Guts"" [5] = 5

Teller|GM

She lifts the board and stalks forward, but as she raises it to swing the wood explodes into splinters, flying with aggressive accuracy into the side and front of her face. She squeezes her eyes shut and whips her head around, managing to avoid the worst of the splinters.

""My house,"" Playpen coughs, then looks up her. Her face is back to normal, though her nose is still broken and lines of vomit are running down her chin. The other board rises up behind Cam, and swings for her head.

    ROLL: ""Board"" [3] = 3

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [1] = 1

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts - Recover"" [4] = 4

She staggers, and the world around her swims from the force of the blow, but she manages to stay on her feet. Barely.

Panda|Ash

""Your house...""

She concedes the point, while moving forward sluggishly to plant another blow to the face of the surprisingly tenacious little girl.

""But I think... it's past your bedtime.""

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [2] -1 = 1

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Guts"" [2] = 2

Playpen barely blocks the blow, and then stands up shakily, seemingly finished with her heaving. Why won't the child go down and stay down? What sort of steroids was the PRT feeding her?

""Didn't read me a story,"" she retorts. Then, out of nowhere, she comments. ""And you're naked.""

The metal spike, smaller and more jagged now, hurls itself at Ash's back.

    ROLL: ""Metal Spike"" [4] +1 = 5

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts"" [4] = 4

    ROLL: ""Ashcloud’s Guts - Recover"" [4] = 4

She sees the metal sticking out of her front, before she feels the pain. When it hits her, it's severe enough that she finds that her legs give out under her. She goes to her knees, barely still functioning.

This is it, she's sure. This is it, and this damn implacable child is standing over her, staring.

Panda|Ash

If she's going down, she's going down swinging goddamn it!

And so, she does, once again.

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [4] -2 = 2

Teller|GM

    ROLL: ""Playpen’s Guts"" [3] = 3

She drags herself forward, ignoring the blood flowing down her chest, and swings her fist at Playpen. The girl blocks, then dances backwards. More like stumbling, but relative to Ash's current abilities it might as well be dancing.

The world wavers around her. It's hard to tell the cracking and shifting from her own wavering vision. Playpen smiles at her.

Panda|Ash

This is... not good.

And to think, all she wanted this morning was a meeting and some ice cream.

Slowly, carefully, painfully Cameron Young pushes herself to her feet one last time.

Steadying herself as if she were bracing against a tidal wave, the woman gives a blood-laced grin to her opponent.

She has no words left to give, nor did she trust that she could give them and still fight.

Because what was she if she couldn't - didn't - fight?

Mustering up her remaining energy and wrath, overwhelmed by pain and exhaustion as it was, she gives her all one last time in a stumble that turns into a falling punch that's 70% 'falling' and 30% 'punch'.

    ROLL: ""Athletics"" [3] -2 = 1

    ROLL: ""Brawn"" [1] -2 = -1

Teller|GM

She staggers forward one step, two, three. Playpen waits, but Cameron's body gives up. She swings weakly as she falls, but it's closer to flopping her arm.

She lies there, on the dusty, shifting floor, bleeding, the metal of her own goddamn Tinker suit sticking out of her back.

Playpen looks at her for a few moments to make sure she's not going to move again, then sits down crosslegged on the floor a few feet away from her. She swipes ineffectively at her face, trying to clear away the vomit, then rests her chin on her hands.

And she watches Cameron Young die."
