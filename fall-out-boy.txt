I-I-I-I can't explain a thing
I-I-I-I want everything to change and stay the same
Oh, time doesn't care
About anyone or anything
Come together, come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts
And oh baby, when they made me, they broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
I'm a mascot for what you've become
I love the mayhem more than the love
And oh baby, when they made me, they broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them cause I just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh oh though change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Preach electric to a microphone stand
We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery
Go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane? (Passenger plane)
Permanent jet lag
Please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in (Please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in
It feels like fourteen carats but no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king
Goes to the desert, the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said
"We won, oh we won"
Permanent jet lag
Please take me back (Please take me back)

Have you ever wanted to disappear?
It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my egos in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I saidIf home is where the heart is
Then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember the good old days
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
The m-m-milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction
Chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align
You're just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky
Are all the good times getting gone?
They come and go and go and come and go
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
If home is where the heart is
Then we're all just fuckedI'm sleeping my way out of this one
With anyone who will lie down
I'll be stuck fixated on one star
When the world is crashing down
I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own
The only thing worse than not knowing
Is you thinking that I don't know
I'm having another episode
I just need a stronger dose
I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself
Keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra
Ta-ra-ra-ra
Doo, doo, doo
I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself
Keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my ownI confess, I messed up
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around
And I know you dressed up
"Hey, kid, you'll never live this down"
And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said
"Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
Write me off, give up on me
'Cause darling, what did you expect?
I'm just off, a lost cause
A long shot, don't even take this bet
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said
"Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
Always on
You said you'd keep me honest
(Always on)
But I won't call you on it
(Always on)
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always lateI don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet
Because
I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah

But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the endShe's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort ‘em out
And you can kill me, kill me or...whoa
I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, Stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep, whoa
Altar boys, altered boys
We’re the things that love destroys
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We’re just resurrection men
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
Us, we were only meant, to make you live again
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)You could have knocked me out with a feather
I know you've heard this all before, but we're just Hell's neighbors
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
In my dreams trees grow all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars (cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media Blitz
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
You can bow and pretend that
You don't, don't know you're a legend
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
(..Sorry I just..) Let my love loose again
I don't know much about classic cars (cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike

Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess

When you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits
Best friends
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars
Yo ho ho
Oh ho ho
Yo ho ho
Oh ho ho
(This city says...)
Come hell or high water
Well, I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital
Best friends
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars
Yo ho ho
Oh ho ho
Yo ho ho
Oh ho ho
The tombstones were waiting
They were half-engraved
They knew it was over
Just didn't know the date
And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist
Best friends
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as loversI'm pedal to the metal make no mistake
This is my pity party, pity party
And I'm living out of time, eternal heatstroke
Spiritual revolt from the waist down
From the waist down
I'm just a full tank away from freedom
Spitfire
These are the last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
I got a feeling inside that I can't domesticate
It doesn't wanna live in a cage
A feeling that I can't housebreak
And I'm yours
'Til the earth starts to crumble and the heavens roll away
I'm struggling to exist with you and without you, yeah
I'm just a full tank away from freedom
Spitfire
These are the last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
I'm sifting through the sand, sand, sand
Looking through pieces of broken hourglass
Trying to get it all back
Put it back together
As if the time had never passed
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away
But I just want to let you break my brain
And I can't seem to get a grip
No matter how I live with it
These are the last blues, yeah
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left

This story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging up
There's a song on the radio that says:
"Let's get this party started."
So let's get this party started
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse
I just never want to know
What meant the world had folded
Like legs and fingers holding onto what escapes me;
What he has: a better kiss that never lasts
You said, between your smiles and regrets:
"Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah
The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too
This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute
There's one born every minute
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse
I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted
All my oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance to say...
Between your smiles and regrets:
"Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone, dead and gone
The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight, yeah
Sun burnt out tonight, the sun burnt out tonightDu du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youthYou are a getaway car, a rush of blood to the head
But me, I'm just the covers on top of your bed
You steer away in a rear view mirror, make my head swim
I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt
Oh yeah, you caught me but I caught you one worse
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war."
But who are you fighting for?
The tide's out, the ship's run aground
We drown traitors in shallow water
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
Everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shameChampion, champion
I'm calling you from the future
To let you know we've made a mistake
And there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me such a headache
And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside, I got nothing but dreams
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
Champion, champion
Champion, champion
I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light
I'm trying to blow out the light
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
Champion, champion
I can do anything
Champion, champion
And I can do anything
Champion, champion
And I can do anything
Champion, champion
I can do anything!
If I can live through this

If I can live through this
I can do anything
I can do anything
I can do anything
I can do anything!
Champion, championMy heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness
Means that I believed
Every single lie you said
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
She took me down and said:
"Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath."
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
You want apologies
Girl, you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get
Is this curse on your lips:
(Every pane of-)
I hope they taste of me forever
(Every pane of glass)
There's a light on in Chicago
(Every pane of)
And I know I should be home
(Every pane of glass)
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, again
(But there’s a light on)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, againShe says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"
Vs. "no one should ever feel like..."
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
I need them just to get by
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
I need them just to get by
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, danceHope this is the last time
'Cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's been dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
This conversation's been dead on
A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus
And here is your verse
No, it's not the last time
'Cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's still dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
When you're dead on
A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus
And here is your...
Whoo!
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
So-o-o-o
This is side one
Flip me over
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus
And here is your verse
Here is your...I want to see your animal side
Let it all out
I wanna see the dirt
Under your skin
I need your broken promises
I want the guts and glory baby
This town is wasted and alone
But we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are alive
I want to see your animal side
Let it all out
Oh there you go; undress to impress
You can wear the crown but you’re no princess
So put the “D” in dirt now baby, baby
Let’s get you wasted and alone
Cause we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are alive
We’re going to die
It’s just a matter of time
Hard times come
Good times go
I’m either gone in an instant
Or here 'till the bitter end
I never know
What I’ve got will make you feel more alive
I’ll be your favorite drug, I will get you high
I will get you high
We're still, we are alive
Here in death valley
But don’t take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it’s just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
But we are aliveI'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams
Now buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a cat scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable
Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet
So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys
With their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
Oh, little girl, you got me staring odd
Or was it just a telescopic camera nod
Painted doors in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk, when you leave the room
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I am half doomed and you're semi-sweet
So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys
With their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
(Detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox)
So boycott love
(Detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox)
Boycott love
(Detox just to retox)
Boycott love
(Detox just to retox)
So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys
With their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing—)
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
WhoaWhoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Penny for your thoughts but a dollar for your insights
Or a fortune for your disaster
I'm just a painter and I'm drawing a blank
We only want to sing you to sleep
Through your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get me just right
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
Oh oh oh oh
I could learn to pity fools as I'm the worst of all
And I can't stop feeling sorry for myself
Whoa
We only want to sing you to sleep
Through your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get us right
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
We only want to sing you to sleep
(Your bedroom speakers, whoa oh)
We only want to sing you to sleep
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank and we walk the plank
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
We're broken down on memory lane
Alone together, we're alone
We're broken down on memory lane
Alone together, we're alone
Oh oh oh ohDo you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to)
(Spin for you like your favorite records)
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
And I can’t, I can’t
I can’t remember just how to forget
Forget the way that we danced
We danced to Danzig
And we danced, we danced
And when you ask, you ask me how I’m doing
Like you know, you know how much better off I am
And when we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to)
(Spin for you like your favorite records)
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yoooooou-oooh-oh
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to
Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to)It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of JulyI've loved everything about you that hurt
So let me see your moves
Let me see your moves
Lips pressed close to mine
True blue
But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night
If it's a drive back home
Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
You almost pick up the phone
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind
But I've got a lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down
Whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring myself out
Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
I almost pick up the phone
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
Born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
"Cross my heart and hope to die
Splintered from the headboard in my eye"
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
Now press repeatThis has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
But we never stood a chance
And I'm not sure if it matters
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town
Your secret's out
I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming
Into microphones for attention
Because we're just so bored
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
Your secret's out
I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter
I used to obsess over living
Now I only obsess over you
Tell me you'd like boys like me better
In the dark lying on top of you
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
I know this hurts, it was meant to (it was meant to)
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't, don't, don't matter
From day one, I talked about getting out
But not forgetting about
How my worst fears are letting out
He said why put a new address
On the same old loneliness
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die
Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address
On the same old loneliness
And this is you and me
And me and you
Until we've got nothing leftWhere is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
The hope I forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you (for you, so...)
You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
The meantime, I'll sport my brand new fashion
Of waking up with pants on
At four in the afternoon
You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
1-2-3-4!
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
(Won't find out) He won't find out
(Won't find out) He won't find out
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of townMy heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a "Big shot talent"
But at the end of the day you know
Where we come from
And where we call home
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
They'll say it's not worth it
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a "Big shot talent"
But at the end of the day you know
Those busted lips we take back home
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
So, hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you backMr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room the walls lean in to listen
Surfed out brain waves flick back and forth
Like old headlights sniffing model glue again
Head like a steel trap
Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't
I don't just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Aw, Tempest in a teacup
Get unique
Peroxide princess shine like shark teeth
It's a sign (it's a sign), it's a sign (it's a sign)
It's a sign: what if you peaked early?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
Does he, does he know the way I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does he know?
Does he know?
Does he know?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going throughOne look from you
And I'm on that faded love
Out of my body
And flying above
If there were any more left of me
I'd give it to you
And I'll tell you that I am fine
But I'm a missile that's guided to you
Go out in the world to start over again and again
As many times as ya can
And in the end if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Would you give me, give me, give me, give me a boost
A boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
I got dreams of my own
But I want to make yours come true
So please come through
Honey please, please come through
You're, you're out in the world, start over again and again
As many times as you can
And if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit
You're the one, you're the one

Give me a boost over heaven's gate
Give me a boostOh na na na na na na na na
I never really feel a thing
I'm just kinda too frozen
You were the only one
That even kinda came close
I just pinch myself
No longer comatose
I woke up, no luck
I woke up, no luck
And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
I got too high again
Realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend
I love you to death
But I just can't, I just can't pretend
We weren't lovers first
Confidants but never friends
Were we ever friends?
And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight

'Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight

And I'm grounding all my dreams
Of ever really seeing California
'Cause I know what's in between
Is something sensual in such non-conventional ways
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't (say)
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
(Tonight I'm writing you) a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you"
(We miss you) "We miss you" (We miss you)
Tonight is all about "We miss you"
And I can't forget your style or your cynicism
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen
To everything we said
My smile's an open wound without you
And my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
(Tonight I'm writing you) a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you"
(We miss you) "We miss you" (We miss you)
Tonight is all about "We miss you"
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
These friends are, new friends are goldenIt's all a game of this or that, now verses then
Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
(Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
Vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them tooSay my name, and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth
Free love on the streets, but
In the alley it ain't that cheap now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said-a, I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, you said-a
I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me, you said-a
I don't care (I don't care)
You said I don't care (I don't care)
Said I don't care, I don't care
I don't care (I don't care), I said-a, I don't care
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in miseryI found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know
And some secrets weren't meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now
Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume, it's so
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family 'cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place
Brace yourself
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But, for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left
So progress report: I am missing you to death
Douse yourself in cheap perfume, it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume, it's so
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up

Feeling borrowed

You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
Douse yourself in cheap perfume, it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it upLast year's wishes are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance to burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
'Cause I know how the words get you (off)
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods but I love
The tree I used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
The best way to make it through
With hearts and wrists intact
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad, ain't bad
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you (honeymoon)
Setting in a honeymoon
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
HoneymoonThey say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your favorite dreams
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
I try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound but they’re my sutures
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
I try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals
Immortals
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
ImmortalsComing in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in but, honey, I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri but the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, babyI speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself, no
So listen carefully to every word I say
I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
Blackmailed myself
('Cause I ain't got) 'Cause I ain't got anyone else
This is a stick up
Give us all your inspiration
I've got the red carpet blues, baby
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're going to shoot you
We're going to shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes, no
We're going to shoot you
We're going to shoot you
When I said that I'd return to you, I meant more like a relapse
Now and again I think "His and hers, for better or worse"
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
I've got the red carpet blues, baby
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're going to shoot you
We're going to shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're going to shoot you
We're going to shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes
Everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
But don't get the wrong idea
We're going to shoot you
We're going to shoot you
Now press repeatJoke me something awful just like kisses
On the necks of "best friends"
We're the kids who feel like dead ends
And I want to be known for my hits, not just my misses
I took a shot and didn't even come close
At trust and love and hope
And the poets are just kids who didn't make it
And never had it, at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides, my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself
To everyone else around me
Please put the doctor on the phone
'Cause I'm not making any sense
Blame everyone but me for this mess
And my back has been breaking from this heavy heart
We never seemed so far
I'm hopelessly hopeful
You're just hopeless enough
But we never had it, at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides, my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself
To everyone else around me
To everyone else around me
Everyone else around me
Everyone else around meYou're a canary, I'm a coal mine
'Cause sorrow is just all the rage
Take one for the team
You all know what I mean
And I'm so sorry but not really
Tell the boys where to find my body
New York eyes, Chicago thighs
Pushed up the window to kiss you off
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
Do you remember the way I held your hand
Under the lamp post and ran home
This way, so many times
I could close my eyes?
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth
The truth
Now, press repeatI got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?
Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?
Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?
Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"I thought of angels
Choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them
Pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s reign
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
Letting people down is my thing baby
Find yourself a new gig
This town ain’t big enough for two of us
I don’t have the right name
Or the right looks
But I have twice the heart
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name (name)
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s reign
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
And now I’m here to give you all of my love (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So I can watch your face as I take it all away (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s reign
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohHoney is for bees silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep
It doesn't matter how you feel
Life is just a ferris wheel
It's always up and down
Don't make a sound
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
It's just the sweet weather and the peacock feathers
In the morning it will all be better
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
Honey is for bees silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleepDon’t panic
No, not yet
I know I’m the one you want to forget
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It’s time for me to fall apart
Now you’re gone
But I’ll be okay
Your hot whiskey eyes
Have fanned the flames
Maybe I’ll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life
Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin
I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you’d take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh
We’re fading fast
I miss missing you now and then
Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we’re sitting in the dark
So give me your filth
Make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love
I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh and I’ve heard you got it, got it so bad
Cause I am the best you’ll never have
Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin
I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you’d take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh
We’re fading fast
I miss missing you now and then
Now and then
Now and then
Now and then
Now and then
Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and thenI spent most of last night dragging this lake
For the corpses of all my past mistakes
Sell me out, the joke's on you
We are salt and you are the wound
Empty another bottle and let me tear you to pieces
This is me wishing you into the worst situations
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go
But you wouldn't know a good thing
If it came up and slit your throat
Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears
Rather ones that just don't care
'Cause I know that you're in between arms, somewhere
Next to heartbeats where you shouldn't dare sleep
Now, I'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me
Take your taste back, peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
No once in a while
Take your taste back, peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
No once in a while
And did you hear the news?
I could dissect you and gut you on this stage
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined
But it will get the job done and you're done
Every line is plotted and designed
To leave you standing on your bedroom window's ledge
And everyone else that it hits, that it gets to
Is nothing more than collateral damage
Take your taste back, peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
No once in a while
Take your taste back, peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
No once in a whileBe careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, darkDrink down that gin and kerosene
Come spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me be
I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying
Drink down that gin and kerosene
Come spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everydayThis is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
I’m just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Fill it up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
Ooooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for youOh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you
We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive
(Now I only waste it dreaming of you)
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same
You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
I used to waste my time on
Waste my time on
Waste my time dreaming of being alive
(Now I only waste it dreaming of you)
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I'm not trying
You only hold me up like this
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains
Like I'll never be the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohBrothers and sisters, put this record down
Take my advice 'cause we are bad news
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."
We're only liars but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
Brothers and sisters, yeah, put these words down
Into your notebook
(Spit lines like these)
We're friends when you're on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."
We're only liars but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion senseSomething makes my chest stir
Something makes my head blur
I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no
I'm just such a happy mess, whoa
The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more
I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now
It's three drinks too late
To talk to anyone but myself
It's a three-and-two pitch
To walk to anywhere else, no
The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more
I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now
I'm the invisible man
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me
So you can get, get addicted to this
You can get, get addicted to this, now
I'm the invisible man (I'm the invisible man)
I'm the invisible man (I'm the invisible)
I want to make you as lonely as me
'Cause I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man...It's Courtney, bitch
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation
So they just DIY'd that shit and built their own bombs
She's his suicide blonde, she's number than gold
Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was, not as I am
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow
If I don't wake up dead,"
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition
And she'd let it go to my head
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
If my love is a weapon
There's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
If my heart is a grenade
You pull the pin and say
We're all fighting, growing old
We're all fighting, growing old
In the (hope)  hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
Cause it's never
Getting any better than this
We are professional ashes of roses
This kerosene's live
You settled your score
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do baby, we nightmare you
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heartbeat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church
In the middle of the desert getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where it went wrong
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
If my love is a weapon
There's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey

You pull the pin and say
We're all fighting, growing old
We're all fighting, growing old

It's never
Getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never
Getting any better than this
She's sick and she's wrong
She's your dirty blonde
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
He says "I've seen bigger"
She says "I've lived better"
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
We're all fighting growing old
We're all fighting growing old
In the (hope) hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get get on St. Peter's list

Are you ready for another bad poem?I could walk this fine line between elation and success
But we all know which way I'm going to strike the stake between my chest
So, "You have to prove yourself"
You'll have to prove it to me
So now you're waiting up for him
You're wasting time, yeah, every time
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am
A failure at everything, 18 going on extinct
I know my place, it's nowhere you should roam
So now you're waiting up for him
Still wasting time, yeah, every time
Yeah
Whoa, I can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself

You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up (oh)
So put away your make up
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way
(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light[x2]
(Roxanne) Put on the red light

Put on the red lightUntil your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your, forever, forever
I need more dreams
And less life
And I need that dark
In a little more light
And I cried tears you’ll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be
You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream
No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I'm only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I'm only plugged in to save rock and roll
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your, forever, forever
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of our generation
Woah
How’d it get to be only me?
Like I’m the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes
I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
The songs that we can't stop singing
No, no (No, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I'm only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
No, no (No, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)

I'm only plugged in to save rock and roll (rock and roll)
Oh no, we won't go

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh ohI am such a sucker
And I'm always the last to know
My insides are copper
I'd kill to make them gold
Conversation got me here
Another night alone in the city
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets
Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true
When you go, I will forget everything about you
When you go, I will forget everything about you
I have seen sinking ships go down with more grace than you
Turn this up, I'll tune you out
Another night alone in the city, yeah
Fake it like you matter
That's a lie we can both keep, oh
Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true
When you go, I will forget everything about you
When you go, I will forget everything about you
I will forget (when you go
I will forget everything about you)
When you go (I will forget everything about you)

Life's just a pace-car on death
Only less diligent
And when the two collide
It's no coincidence
The lights are on and everybody's home
The only thing suicidal here is the doors
We had a good run
Even I have to admit
Life's just a pace-car on death
Only less diligent
Hell or glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
We didn't come to compete
This is a demonstration
Even the young ones become irrelevant
They always bring up how you've changed
Never the same person when I go to sleep
As when I wake up
As when I wake up
Bop bop ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Hell or glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh

Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh

Woah oh oh
He said "bring the thunder!"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh

Woah oh oh oh ohShow me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid
I, I, I will break his jaw
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up
No-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
And I will save him from himself
Here's a picture with a note
"No, don't turn out like me"
It's only for your own good
No-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
And haven't you heard
The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"
Get out into the sun
Out from behind the gossip
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking
Keep this alive

The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
Hey, hey [x3]
Even when there's
N-n-n-n-nothing worth living for
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for
N-no one has to know-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
And haven't you heard
The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"
Get out into the sun

Stop!Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers
Delivering just what you need
We're well-read and poised
We're the best boys
We're the chemists who've found the formula
To make your heart swell and burst
No matter what they say, don't believe a word
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it
I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We're traveled like gypsies
Only with worse luck and far less gold
We're the kids you used to love
But then we grew old
We're the lifers here till the bitter end
Condemned from the start
Ashamed of the way
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
And there's another around to help us bend your trust
Got a sunset in my veins
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay
The best part of "believe" is the "lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up
The best part of "believe" is the "lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up
Are we growing up or just going down?
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the lightI think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm about to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision
So stuck night vision
But I come to life, come to life
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, we are living fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?

Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistanceAm I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swinging
(Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're going down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
(Take aim at myself)
And Sugar, we're going down swinging

I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull itI don't even have my own attention
You say "please don't ever change"
But you don't like me the way I am
The sign says don't tap the glass
But I read it in reverse, ssalg eht pat t'nod syas ngis ehT
The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way
I can't forget it
Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in
She said I love you till I don't
I am just playing house
No idea what I'm doing now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me
It's time to throw in the towel
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
The sunshine
Call me Oluwaburna
I fell in love but I didn't fall down
They say me nah normal
Drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan
Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain
Passing it to my fuckin' guys
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through
Got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...
The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun
You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much
It's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown
Petulant but irreverent
Take all your possibilities and take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling-
I was stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling al-
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sunLight that smoke, that one for giving up on me
And one just 'cause they’ll kill you sooner than my expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar (to my favorite scar)
I could have died with you
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle
Confess (bury me in memory)
Now ask yourself, yeah, out on the insides
Said I loved you but I lied
Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire
I wouldn’t piss to put you out"
Stop burning bridges, and drive off of them
So I can forget about you
So bury me in memory
His smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (his teeth)
Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire
I wouldn’t piss to put you out"
Stop burning bridges, and drive off of them
So I can forget about you
So bury me in memory
His smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory
His smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory
Around your throatI'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
And the full moon pills got me out on the street at night
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Oh, put love on hold
Young Hollywood is on the other line
Her nose runs ruby red, Death's in a double bed
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose (Watch you work the room)
I'm a stitch away...Sometimes I want to quit this all and become an accountant now
But I'm no good at math and besides the dollar is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old
I want to scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports and get get get get get out now
All the Yes men said 'no comment'
My mouth got going the wrong way and all the calls started snowing
The time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back
I want to scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports, get out now
Tell that boy I'll leave you alone now
Like a stove, I'll turn my love down
Supra and the prophet are both in the business of souls
I want to scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
I want to scream 'I love you' from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town
(know we're gonna leave this town)
And get new passports and get get get get get out
Get get get get get out now!We take sour sips from life's lush lips
And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships
Stomp out this disaster town
You'll put your eyes to the sun and say, "I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding."
And we might have started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh
We keep the beat with your blistered feet
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
Slept through the weekend and dreaming
Of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying, "How you been?"
We might have said goodbyes just a little soon
(Stomp out this disaster town)
Robbing lips, kissing banks under this moon
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh
It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunningStuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alrightI was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you
And then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you
Spinning around you
You were too good to be true
Gold plated
But what's inside you?
But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do
As much as I do, yeah
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you
But only for you
My head is stripped just like a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you
When I think of you
I will shield you from the waves
If they find you
I will protect you
I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me
I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true
Even if it's not true, yeah
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
I'm here at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm here at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams
The thing that I believe
Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams
The thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete

Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
Baby, we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
Cause you think, you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing
Whoa

They fall in love

The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
It's getting clear
You're never coming clean
So lock you up inside and swallow, swallow the key
Hello?
Yeah I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
Well, I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through
You know how we do
Some times I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin or workin', so the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you
Whoa

The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in loveI got my stitches stitched, I got my fixes fixed
In my aching head, I got my kisses slit
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back
It's true romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your prince
Because they've got me in a bad way I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs, it was competition
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest...
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
I'm casually obsessed and I've forgiven death
I am indifferent, yet (I am a total wreck)
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your prince
Because they've got me in a bad way I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs, it was competition
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest...
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
(Go!)
I went to sleep a poet, and I woke up a fraud
To calm your nerves I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chancesI'm holding out and I'm holding on
To every letter and every song
I wrote myself out of the day we ever had to meet
You through with me?
So
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
(Let's go!)
I'm all ears and I'm all scars
To hear you tell me "Boy's like you, you try too hard
To look not quite as desperate"
I'm hanging on
But I still know the way to make your makeup run
So
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell (Take this to your grave)
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face (I'll take it to mine)
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goesPut on your war paint
You are a brick tied to me that’s dragging me down
Strike a match and I’ll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
Put on your war paint
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver Clouds with grey lining
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re
Waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, Youngblood doesn’t it feel like our time is running out
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Bring home the boys in scraps
Scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re
Waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, Youngblood doesn’t it feel like our time is running out
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
Hey, Youngblood doesn’t it feel like our time is running out
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, Youngblood doesn’t it feel like our time is running out
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paintBury me standing under your window with this cinder block in hand
Yeah 'cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move, I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block
They were gone by the time we (talked)
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing
I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun
Remind me which side you should be on
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voiceBaby, seasons change but people don't
And I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us till
This doesn't mean a thing anymore
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed in secret places, woah
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed in secret places, woah
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fairI am an arms dealer fitting you
With weapons in the form of words
And (don't really care which side wins)
Long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on but I digress
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I wrote the gospel on giving up (you're looking pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk (prima-donnas of the gutter)
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Now you)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Wear out the groove)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Sing out loud)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Oh, oh)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lines I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricateI'm going to make it bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings)
Say a prayer but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for (except for)
When you look into the past (look into the past)
One night stand (one night stand, oh)
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
One night and one more time
(One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night and one more time
(One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
(For the memories)
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here!
Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, "Now in stores"
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave...
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
Hehe, woo!
Young! F-O-B
Let's goI'm not a crybaby, I'm the crybaby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth, come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart
I'm cocktail party doing alright
Hate me baby
Maybe I'm a piece of art
Oh, my friends all lie and say
They only want the best wishes for me
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
Your pupils (big) big (roll)
They're rolling like dice
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity
You held me down in this starless city
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity
You held me down in this starless city
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night till we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til you find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you shrug
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
A birth and a death on the same day
And, honey, I only appear so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onI can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apartI'm a young one
Stuck in the thoughts
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirring awake
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again, woah
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone
Guild me, build me
It's your club, so let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming
It is inside your skin
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone
Mama
If we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days
We won't sleep for days
Mama
If we pray to the lord
Does he sing on a stage?
Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
I want to get stuck
I want to get stuck
And be golden in your memoryWishes bounce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated
And this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right
The P.A. system keeps my heart heart beating tonight
Oh hell yes
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Come on in, the water's warm
Come on like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head
Like putting wings on lead
And your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind
And that's all that should matter t-t-to you
Follow the disorganized religion of my head
And we'll never get through customs
Let's just take off again instead
Got my degree in the gutter
My heart broken in the dorms of the ivy league
Oh hell yes
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck huh
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes
The drugs just make me reset (The drugs just make me reset)
Knock once for the father (for the father)
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times
Three times for the holy ghostI got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
You'll never catch us
So just let me be
Said, "I'll be fine
'Til the hospital or American embassy"
Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
I got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way
I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you
They say the captain
Goes down with the ship
So, when the world ends
Will God go down with it?
Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
I got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way
I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you
What a catch, what a catch, what a catch, what a catch
I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
I got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way
I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter
Growing up, growing up
I got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catchNa, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget
Never forget
And all the boys are smoking Menthols,
Girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, yeah
I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun
And you got me all fucked up
On love
I looked for your name on the ouija board
And your naked magic, oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love
And the love on TV, love on TV
And all the boys are smoking Menthols,
Girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again, yeah
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
We were the kids who screamed, "We weren't the same"
In sweaty rooms
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life
So let's fade away together one dream at a time
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na...I was I was I was I was
Gonna say something that would solve all our problems
But then I got drunk and I forgot what I was talking about
I forgot what I was talking about
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
Than to be loved by everybody but you, but you
If I could get my shit together
I'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
Never see any of you again
I hope the roof flies off and I get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
On the wrong side of p-p-paradise
And when I say I'm sorry I'm late, I wasn't showing up at all
I really mean I didn't plan on showing up at all
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you
If I can get my shit together
I'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
Never see any of you again
I hope the roof flies off and I get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
If we hadn't done this thing
I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on our own supply whenever I can
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape
From trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
I'll stop wearing black
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker colorWe've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace
Young and a menace
Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace
Young and a menace
I’m just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...
Fall!
Young and a menace
We've gone way too fast for way too longWhen Rome's in ruins
We are the lions free of the coliseums
In poison places, we are anti venom
We're the beginning of the end
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?
C'mon, make it easy, say I never mattered
Run it up the flag pole
We will teach you how to make boys next door out of assholes (hahaha!)
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?The D.A. is dressed to the nines
In the mirror, he practices all his lines
To his closing argument, twelve hearts beat in favor
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper
The headline reads "The man hangs"
But the jury doesn't
And everyone's looking for relief
United States versus disbelief
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle
Clear your throat and face the world
The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls
Only breathing with the aid of denial
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?
He glances at his peers sitting seven to twelve stacked
On one to six, the gallery is hushed
Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado
The city sleeps in a cell, not withstanding what we all know
Hang on a rope or bated breath
Whichever you prefer
And everyone's looking for relief
A bidding war for an old flame's grief
The cause, the kid, the course
The charm, and the curse
Not a word that could make you comprehend
Too well dressed for the witness stand
The press prays for whichever headline's worse
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?
Fresh pressed suit and tie
Unimpressed birds sing and die
Can talk my way out of anything
The foreman reads the verdict
"In the above entitled actions, we find the defendant..."
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?
