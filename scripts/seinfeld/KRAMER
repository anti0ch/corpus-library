KRAMER
Who did?
KRAMER
Was it more than just one?
KRAMER
What are they gonna do?
KRAMER
Hello?
KRAMER
Kramer.
KRAMER
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
KRAMER
Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my
KRAMER
Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
KRAMER
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been
KRAMER
You know I'm in that movie?
KRAMER
Yeah, I'm an extra.
KRAMER
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked
KRAMER
Clear blue sky!
KRAMER
I got a quality.
KRAMER
Whoa, whoa!!
KRAMER
Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
KRAMER
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block
KRAMER
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and
KRAMER
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
KRAMER
I got a line in the movie!
KRAMER
Pretty good, huh?
KRAMER
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my
KRAMER
Uh, I didn't see him.
KRAMER
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar
KRAMER
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go,
KRAMER
No, no, I'm working on it.
KRAMER
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
KRAMER
I didn't say anything.
KRAMER
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy,
KRAMER
What happened here?
KRAMER
What's an extremity?
KRAMER
You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
KRAMER
What about a big sponge?
KRAMER
Use a belt.
KRAMER
Yes, yes.
KRAMER
Yeah, I've seen them do that.
KRAMER
Maybe that's what he's got.
KRAMER
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
KRAMER
Can you give him a cookie?
KRAMER
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
KRAMER
Alright I'll get a blender.
KRAMER
You got a blender.
KRAMER
What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the
KRAMER
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all
KRAMER
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring
KRAMER
Hey, you seen the paper yet?
KRAMER
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
KRAMER
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
KRAMER
I got fired from the movie.
KRAMER
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it
KRAMER
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And
KRAMER
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that
KRAMER
You're a chucker.
KRAMER
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
KRAMER
Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
KRAMER
Yeah, I snuck a peak.
KRAMER
Why not? hey what about you George?
KRAMER
Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
KRAMER
Have a good one.
KRAMER
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to
KRAMER
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's
KRAMER
George?
KRAMER
(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
KRAMER
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
KRAMER
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, (Hangs up) . . . you know that was
KRAMER
(does a double take) It's too busy
KRAMER
What guy?
KRAMER
Who are you talkin about?
KRAMER
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
KRAMER
I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
KRAMER
Let me tell it ..
KRAMER
You always tell it ..
KRAMER
Ja ja ja - just tell it
KRAMER
Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were
KRAMER
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
KRAMER
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
KRAMER
Back and to the left
KRAMER
Wait, wait, (Exits)
KRAMER
It's Keith.
KRAMER
Hey
KRAMER
Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
KRAMER
Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
KRAMER
All right
KRAMER
Yallo. What delay industries?
KRAMER
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but
KRAMER
no problem, ... no problem. (Hangs up) ... How did YOU know who that
KRAMER
(to baby) Koochie koochie koochie koo
KRAMER
Lyndon Johnson.
KRAMER
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
KRAMER
I'll pick her up.
KRAMER
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be
KRAMER
What's going on?
KRAMER
What? Well, you hardly know the guy.... What a nerve. You see wasn't I
KRAMER
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how
KRAMER
yeah yeah
KRAMER
What?
KRAMER
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. (exits)
KRAMER
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
KRAMER
Hello.
KRAMER
Oh, you don't remember me.
KRAMER
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
KRAMER
Ah, you remember.
KRAMER
No no no, well, then who was it?
KRAMER
Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him
KRAMER
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
KRAMER
Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
KRAMER
Want any help?
KRAMER
I'd love to help you move.
KRAMER
No sweat.
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...
KRAMER
This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
KRAMER
Well, I'm not giving it back.
KRAMER
Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?
KRAMER
Oh, gees...
KRAMER
Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
KRAMER
What?
KRAMER
No, statue.
KRAMER
Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
KRAMER
Oh, I really think you're wrong.
KRAMER
What test?
KRAMER
Why do you take an IQ test?
KRAMER
George?
KRAMER
Why are you taking an IQ test for George?
KRAMER
What, is it for a job or something?
KRAMER
You're positive it's statute?
KRAMER
Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
KRAMER
No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
KRAMER
Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
KRAMER
Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
KRAMER
I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
KRAMER
I thought you took the test.
KRAMER
How come?
KRAMER
Well, you can't leave now.
KRAMER
Never!
KRAMER
Yeah...
KRAMER
I'm going upstairs.
KRAMER
Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
KRAMER
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
KRAMER
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You
KRAMER
Woah, you didn't like her?
KRAMER
How come you never said anything?
KRAMER
I tell you.
KRAMER
I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do
KRAMER
Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,
KRAMER
I went back with Ellen.
KRAMER
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
KRAMER
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you
KRAMER
I'm getting my pot.
KRAMER
Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
KRAMER
Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
KRAMER
Well, you were right.
KRAMER
Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
KRAMER
I'll bring back the pot.
KRAMER
Hey, what are you gonna see?
KRAMER
Hey, that's supposed to be great.
KRAMER
How do you know?
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
KRAMER
Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this,
KRAMER
Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
KRAMER
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
KRAMER
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
KRAMER
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of
KRAMER
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says
KRAMER
Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They
KRAMER
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are
KRAMER
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean,
KRAMER
Right.
KRAMER
Defective.
KRAMER
I didn't even know they were defective.
KRAMER
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
KRAMER
Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the
KRAMER
Hey! (Group does likewise)
KRAMER
What? What? What? Tell me.
KRAMER
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like
KRAMER
They should be sent to Australia.
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
KRAMER
No.
KRAMER
Yeah?
KRAMER
I don't know!
KRAMER
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I
KRAMER
Yep. (Mumbles off)
KRAMER
Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
KRAMER
What happened?!
KRAMER
I think I hit my head again!
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
What?
KRAMER
Mary Hart!
KRAMER
Hey, you know who owns that car?
KRAMER
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
KRAMER
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long
KRAMER
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
KRAMER
How could you?
KRAMER
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
KRAMER
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and
KRAMER
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of
KRAMER
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
KRAMER
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a
KRAMER
Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
KRAMER
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had
KRAMER
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
KRAMER
It's just me.
KRAMER
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
KRAMER
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
KRAMER
Alright, alright...
KRAMER
Sorry.
KRAMER
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
KRAMER
What?
KRAMER
Oh, come on!
KRAMER
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
KRAMER
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
KRAMER
What point?
KRAMER
Just give me another chance!
KRAMER
I'm asking you!
KRAMER
You're joking.
KRAMER
It's not going to happen again!
KRAMER
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
KRAMER
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
KRAMER
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
KRAMER
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
KRAMER
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
KRAMER
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
KRAMER
That's right.
KRAMER
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
KRAMER
Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
KRAMER
Well, you can get 'em back.
KRAMER
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
KRAMER
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
KRAMER
Do you ever yearn?
KRAMER
I yearn.
KRAMER
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
KRAMER
Look at you.
KRAMER
You're wasting your life.
KRAMER
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
KRAMER
You got money?
KRAMER
Do you have a woman?
KRAMER
Do you have any prospects?
KRAMER
You got anything on the horizon?
KRAMER
Do you have any action at all?
KRAMER
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
KRAMER
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
KRAMER
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
KRAMER
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
KRAMER
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
KRAMER
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
KRAMER
Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
KRAMER
Hey! You ever been in an accident?
KRAMER
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
KRAMER
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
KRAMER
Oh, he's cold.
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
KRAMER
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
KRAMER
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
KRAMER
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
KRAMER
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
KRAMER
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
KRAMER
Really?
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
KRAMER
Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
KRAMER
Steven.
KRAMER
Oh - I'm familiar with it.
KRAMER
You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I'll do it!
KRAMER
Well, why don't you take your clothes off?
KRAMER
(debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little secret.
KRAMER
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really,
KRAMER
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
KRAMER
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
KRAMER
Why, what's the difference?
KRAMER
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
KRAMER
Yeah!
KRAMER
George, you gonna buy a painting?
KRAMER
(immediately) Yeah.
KRAMER
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer
KRAMER
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
KRAMER
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
KRAMER
Oh, hey.
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
KRAMER
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
KRAMER
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey,
KRAMER
A picture.
KRAMER
Uh-huh.
KRAMER
Yup, yup!
KRAMER
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your
KRAMER
Hi, Mike.
KRAMER
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever
KRAMER
(emotionally) She's deep.
KRAMER
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
KRAMER
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a
KRAMER
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight
KRAMER
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a
KRAMER
Yeah, sure. Please.
KRAMER
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
KRAMER
enters
KRAMER
What's the problem?
KRAMER
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's
KRAMER
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
KRAMER
Oh, memory burn.
KRAMER
How did they ever find you?
KRAMER
You know I never got a library card.
KRAMER
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading
KRAMER
Yeah,
KRAMER
The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned
KRAMER
Tryin' to save a quarter.
KRAMER
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ...
KRAMER
Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
KRAMER
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
KRAMER
yeah
KRAMER
Ooh tattle tale
KRAMER
What did this guy do? What happened?
KRAMER
Oh come on, You can tell me.
KRAMER
What tonight?
KRAMER
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
KRAMER
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
KRAMER
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do
KRAMER
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library
KRAMER
What's wrong?
KRAMER
So I didn't do anything wrong.
KRAMER
Why don't ya' leave?
KRAMER
Read another poem.
KRAMER
Wow, that is great. You should be published.
KRAMER
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
KRAMER
HELLO!
KRAMER
HELLO!
KRAMER
(reading) sobs
KRAMER
It's marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
KRAMER
Hey!
KRAMER
What, you took a cab?
KRAMER
How much do you make?
KRAMER
C'mon.
KRAMER
I'll tell you how much I make.
KRAMER
You ever seen Michael Jordan?
KRAMER
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
KRAMER
Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
KRAMER
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
KRAMER
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
KRAMER
That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
KRAMER
O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
KRAMER
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry.
KRAMER
Who?
KRAMER
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
KRAMER
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,
KRAMER
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry,
KRAMER
I can't believe I didn't see it.
KRAMER
You don't think so.
KRAMER
Maybe he's with the company.
KRAMER
The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization
KRAMER
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's
KRAMER
What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise.
KRAMER
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs
KRAMER
O'Brien.
KRAMER
O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
KRAMER
Yeah? Eva?
KRAMER
O'Brien? Well that's weird.
KRAMER
So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house
KRAMER
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
KRAMER
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.
KRAMER
Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going
KRAMER
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at
KRAMER
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
KRAMER
What? What?
KRAMER
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
KRAMER
Well, I was just trying to help out.
KRAMER
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
KRAMER
I'm proud of you.
KRAMER
Well I don't, I'm guessing.
KRAMER
You got butchered.
KRAMER
Where are you going?
KRAMER
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
KRAMER
I don't have it, I threw it out.
KRAMER
I told you, I threw it out.
KRAMER
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
KRAMER
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
KRAMER
No, you told me not to!
KRAMER
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah!
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got
KRAMER
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
KRAMER
Because we're engaged.
KRAMER
Um hm.
KRAMER
It's my mom's.
KRAMER
Yes, yes I am.
KRAMER
Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
KRAMER
My contention?
KRAMER
Yes, that's my contention.
KRAMER
She does fine work.
KRAMER
You don't say?
KRAMER
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
KRAMER
Well, I'll check
KRAMER
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I looked in there
KRAMER
Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
KRAMER
Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
KRAMER
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
KRAMER
Look I'm telling-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm
KRAMER
A stall man, huh?
KRAMER
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
KRAMER
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him
KRAMER
That's right.
KRAMER
Oh, he's a dunker.
KRAMER
And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, like I'm
KRAMER
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or
KRAMER
Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
KRAMER
...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe,
KRAMER
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot
KRAMER
I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
KRAMER
No no, he's fine.
KRAMER
Where?
KRAMER
Wait, wait. *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table) *bang*
KRAMER
You can have this one.
KRAMER
(RE: CAR) It's this way.
KRAMER
No, no, I got it.
KRAMER
If you like her, go talk to her.
KRAMER
She's fat.
KRAMER
I thought it was here.
KRAMER
Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
KRAMER
It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
KRAMER
Dark blue.
KRAMER
Didn't we come in over there?
KRAMER
About two hours.
KRAMER
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
KRAMER
Why? Nobody's around.
KRAMER
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. JERRY Alright.
KRAMER
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
KRAMER
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
KRAMER
Pink eleven. Remember that.
KRAMER
Look at this place. It's huge...
KRAMER
It's got to be here.
KRAMER
I have a pen.
KRAMER
(RE CAR) I found it!
KRAMER
Oh...no.
KRAMER
It was easy the last time.
KRAMER
Right here at the mall.
KRAMER
You drank a whole bottle of water.
KRAMER
So why don't you just go?
KRAMER
Don't you get tired of following rules?
KRAMER
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
KRAMER
Buddy Hackett?
KRAMER
I know.
KRAMER
(pointing) You can go over here.
KRAMER
(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
KRAMER
Jerry!
KRAMER
Does that bother you?
KRAMER
Not at all.
KRAMER
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
KRAMER
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
KRAMER
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
KRAMER
He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
KRAMER
So go.
KRAMER
You and Jerry.
KRAMER
George! George!
KRAMER
Jerry?
KRAMER
Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was? GEORGE Purple 23.
KRAMER
Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
KRAMER
What time is it?
KRAMER
Well at least there's no traffic.
KRAMER
What time does that play start?
KRAMER
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
KRAMER
Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
KRAMER
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen
KRAMER
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
KRAMER
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
KRAMER
Well, where is it?
KRAMER
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
KRAMER
What happened to the car?
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
KRAMER
I must know.
KRAMER
Oh, come on.
KRAMER
Well, please?
KRAMER
Okay, I beg you.
KRAMER
Okay, please! Please tell me!
KRAMER
Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
KRAMER
Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
KRAMER
Alright.
KRAMER
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
KRAMER
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
KRAMER
What, they don't like me?
KRAMER
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
KRAMER
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm
KRAMER
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got
KRAMER
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
KRAMER
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great
KRAMER
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty
KRAMER
You have to know everything, don't you?
KRAMER
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
KRAMER
Beg me.
KRAMER
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just
KRAMER
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No,
KRAMER
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in
KRAMER
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
KRAMER
He thinks you're a phony.
KRAMER
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
KRAMER
A big phone. A big one.
KRAMER
You begged me.
KRAMER
Hello.
KRAMER
Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
KRAMER
What's going on?!
KRAMER
I'll be down in a minute.
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
Why should anything be wrong?
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, I know him.
KRAMER
I go in front first all the time.
KRAMER
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
KRAMER
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
KRAMER
You said it, sister.
KRAMER
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
KRAMER
Oh, congratulations.
KRAMER
Well, you're pregnant.
KRAMER
You're not pregnant?
KRAMER
Are you sure you're not pregnant?
KRAMER
That's weird.
KRAMER
I thought she was pregnant.
KRAMER
When can you park head first?
KRAMER
What about Sundays and holidays?
KRAMER
I'm not going if he's going.
KRAMER
No. Don't, Jerry.
KRAMER
He begged me.
KRAMER
Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
KRAMER
The beach!
KRAMER
I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
KRAMER
Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
KRAMER
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
KRAMER
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
KRAMER
Can I get in on that?
KRAMER
Is Elaine going?
KRAMER
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
KRAMER
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
KRAMER
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just
KRAMER
Tell me about it!
KRAMER
I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
KRAMER
Break up with her
KRAMER
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
KRAMER
Go ahead smell, smell
KRAMER
Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
KRAMER
Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
KRAMER
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach?
KRAMER
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
KRAMER
So you don't think it's a good idea?
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
Is this the interference?
KRAMER
Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
KRAMER
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade
KRAMER
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
KRAMER
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
KRAMER
Okay.
KRAMER
You can smell me without the drink.
KRAMER
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
KRAMER
All right.
KRAMER
That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
KRAMER
Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
KRAMER
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
KRAMER
What's that red dot on your sweater?
KRAMER
Hey, how ya doing?
KRAMER
I'm sorry.
KRAMER
I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the
KRAMER
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that
KRAMER
You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the
KRAMER
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
KRAMER
The party, Long Island?
KRAMER
Hey, what are you doing here?
KRAMER
Where's Jerry?
KRAMER
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's
KRAMER
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the
KRAMER
Not really.
KRAMER
No, I got a girl in the next building
KRAMER
All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch
KRAMER
Well, yeah...
KRAMER
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no
KRAMER
I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six
KRAMER
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with
KRAMER
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
KRAMER
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break
KRAMER
Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob.
KRAMER
His mother was a mudda'.
KRAMER
What did I just say?
KRAMER
Hey,all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
KRAMER
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
KRAMER
What happened?
KRAMER
Wait, wait, wait...
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
Did you hear about Martin?
KRAMER
I can't believe he's in a coma.
KRAMER
He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
KRAMER
Newman! He's good friends with him.
KRAMER
He's got all of my attachments, you know.
KRAMER
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
KRAMER
So what's going on between you and Gina?
KRAMER
Uh, uh.
KRAMER
Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
KRAMER
Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
KRAMER
There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.
KRAMER
I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.
KRAMER
NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.
KRAMER
You should just eat fruit.
KRAMER
???
KRAMER
Hey.
KRAMER
Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.
KRAMER
You're not going?
KRAMER
Why not?
KRAMER
I dig.
KRAMER
I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me.
KRAMER
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
KRAMER
I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything.
KRAMER
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
KRAMER
I wouldn't set foot in your house.
KRAMER
He looks happy to me.
KRAMER
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going.
KRAMER
oh oh oh oh oh
KRAMER
I want my vacuum cleaner!
KRAMER
Heey!
KRAMER
A couple of hours ago.
KRAMER
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
KRAMER
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
KRAMER
Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
KRAMER
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
KRAMER
We played Backgammon in the nude.
KRAMER
She's a sweet kid.
KRAMER
Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
KRAMER
Yeah.
KRAMER
What's this?
KRAMER
They moved in together?
KRAMER
Phew.
KRAMER
Hey, where ya' going?
KRAMER
Um, I'd like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we'll be getting together.
KRAMER
OH! I got to call her back.
KRAMER

KRAMER
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there

KRAMER
It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.

KRAMER

KRAMER
Don't blame me.
KRAMER
It was supposed to erupt.
KRAMER
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
KRAMER

KRAMER
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
KRAMER
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in
KRAMER
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
KRAMER
