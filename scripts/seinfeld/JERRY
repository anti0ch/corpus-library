JERRY
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
JERRY
I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not
JERRY
They cross the wires or something.
JERRY
They stole my car.
JERRY
They did.
JERRY
What should I do, should I call the police?
JERRY
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
JERRY
Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
JERRY
Are you serious?
JERRY
I don't even know if I remember the number.
JERRY
What do I say if he picks up?
JERRY
Hello? Is this 555-8383?
JERRY
Can I ask you a question?
JERRY
Did you steal my car?
JERRY
You did?!
JERRY
That's my car!
JERRY
What are you gonna do with it?
JERRY
Then can I have it back?
JERRY
Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
JERRY
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
JERRY
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
JERRY
Sid left the keys in the car.
JERRY
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
JERRY
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get
JERRY
Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
JERRY
The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
JERRY
Hey Sid, what happened?
JERRY
You left the keys in the car?
JERRY
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
JERRY
This Wednesday?
JERRY
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
JERRY
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all
JERRY
Owen March, I never heard of him.
JERRY
Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
JERRY
What's that?
JERRY
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm
JERRY
Sixty-six years old?
JERRY
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
JERRY
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant,
JERRY
I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
JERRY
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the
JERRY
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to
JERRY
Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
JERRY
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking
JERRY
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought
JERRY
Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
JERRY
Fine.
JERRY
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell
JERRY
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
JERRY
Well that's what's important.
JERRY
How many times you been out with him?
JERRY
Face to face.
JERRY
If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over
JERRY
What is going on out there?
JERRY
So then what?
JERRY
That's great!
JERRY
You mean *a* career.
JERRY
No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
JERRY
Oh my god.
JERRY
Boy, he took it hard.
JERRY
Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west
JERRY
It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's
JERRY
Kramer.
JERRY
Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
JERRY
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
JERRY
I don't have a washcloth.
JERRY
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
JERRY
How you gonna hold it on there?
JERRY
Should we walk him around?
JERRY
No, no that's for a drug overdose.
JERRY
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie
JERRY
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
JERRY
Cookies don't liquefy.
JERRY
What blender? I don't have a blender.
JERRY
I would know if I had a blender.
JERRY
Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five
JERRY
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)
JERRY
Come on up. Okay, they're here.
JERRY
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
JERRY
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
JERRY
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
JERRY
Yeah, that's true.
JERRY
Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
JERRY
I could tell.
JERRY
Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
JERRY
What happened to the car?
JERRY
We don't know!
JERRY
So how'd you hit the car?
JERRY
It's not even my car, it's a rental.
JERRY
Can I get anybody anything?
JERRY
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
JERRY
The extent of the damage would have been far less severe
JERRY
The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie
JERRY
Can he communicate?
JERRY
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before,
JERRY
What community? There's a community?
JERRY
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
JERRY
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
JERRY
That is right, somebody else was driving.
JERRY
Uh huh, what's that?
JERRY
Other drivers?
JERRY
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car.
JERRY
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you
JERRY
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of
JERRY
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY
An overdose of odor? Good question.
JERRY
Ahh.
JERRY
Let me get that.
JERRY
Please.
JERRY
Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
JERRY
What are you doing here?
JERRY
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
JERRY
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a
JERRY
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
JERRY
You chuck.
JERRY
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
JERRY
Believe me I didn't see anything.
JERRY
No, did you?
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just
JERRY
All right
JERRY
All right
JERRY
You know who that is? That's
JERRY
Yeah, that's him.
JERRY
Positive.
JERRY
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
JERRY
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day
JERRY
Hey, should we say something to him?
JERRY
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
JERRY
So?
JERRY
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
JERRY
Really?
JERRY
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
JERRY
Thank you.
JERRY
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
JERRY
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call,
JERRY
Oh. that would be great.
JERRY
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
JERRY
I can't ... I can't
JERRY
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
JERRY
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants
JERRY
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they
JERRY
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were
JERRY
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
JERRY
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I
JERRY
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
JERRY
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're
JERRY
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to
JERRY
For what dinner?
JERRY
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like
JERRY
... this is all .. very confusing.
JERRY
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
JERRY
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
JERRY
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling
JERRY
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi...
JERRY
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
JERRY
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
JERRY
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
JERRY
Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
JERRY
Hellooo Newman.
JERRY
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise
JERRY
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith
JERRY
What happened to your head when you got hit?
JERRY
Again
JERRY
Back and to the left Back and to the left
JERRY
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been
JERRY
But that is not what they would have you believe.
JERRY
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
JERRY
No. What happened to you?
JERRY
I'm Vanadaley Industries?
JERRY
And what is that?
JERRY
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
JERRY
And what do I say about you?
JERRY
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
JERRY
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
JERRY
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
All right we're coming down.
JERRY
Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
JERRY
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
JERRY
Well that was really fun, thanks.
JERRY
Should I shake his hand?
JERRY
Well, ...
JERRY
No, I haven't.
JERRY
This weekend. WOW!
JERRY
Sure, that would be great.
JERRY
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
JERRY
I mean, ... if you want to.
JERRY
Yeah, Friday's okay.
JERRY
Go ahead shake his hand. You're Jerry Seinfeld. You've been on
JERRY
Well, good night (holds hand out and shakes hand)

For a date?

JERRY
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
JERRY

JERRY
Jerry, You want to pick her up?
JERRY

JERRY
So, did you two, uh, ... have uh, ...
JERRY
... You know
JERRY
No!
JERRY
Did he kiss you good night?
JERRY
What do you mean you don't know?
JERRY
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make
JERRY
So, you like him.
JERRY
Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
JERRY

JERRY
That was Keith.
JERRY
He wants me to help him move.
JERRY
You know, furniture.
JERRY
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a
JERRY
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
JERRY
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
JERRY
... I said yes.
JERRY
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
JERRY
hey Kramer do me a favour .
JERRY
Don't mention it to anybody.
JERRY
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
JERRY
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
JERRY
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP( 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some
JERRY
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find
JERRY
Really?
JERRY
I don't know ... six three.
JERRY
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas
JERRY
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
JERRY
DeSoto? What did he do?
JERRY
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
JERRY
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment
JERRY
I know isn't that something?
JERRY
I don't know ... he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break
JERRY
I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
JERRY
Is there a box spring?
JERRY
Is there a box spring?
JERRY
Is that a sectional?
JERRY
Is that a thick marble?
JERRY
STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
JERRY
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I
JERRY
I told you!
JERRY
But why? Why McDowell?
JERRY
Hello, ... oh hi Elaine .. what's going on ... no he just left ... you broke up
JERRY
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
JERRY
Well Biff/ What's next?
JERRY
This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
JERRY
What's that smell? What are you wearing?
JERRY
Manly.
JERRY
So why didn't you say no?
JERRY
Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
JERRY
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
JERRY
I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
JERRY
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
JERRY
Who thinks you're smart?
JERRY
What thing?
JERRY
Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
JERRY
What did you get?
JERRY
What do you say?
JERRY
1409, that's a good score.
JERRY
What did you really get?
JERRY
Of course.
JERRY
I hope so.
JERRY
He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.
JERRY
I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.
JERRY
Well, it's a spider.
JERRY
Bazooka Joe.
JERRY
The buzzer.
JERRY
My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
What's that?
JERRY
Go in, go in!
JERRY
No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.
JERRY
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
JERRY
Casus belli.
JERRY
Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?
JERRY
Oh, it's nothing...
JERRY
Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?
JERRY
This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.
JERRY
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
JERRY
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
JERRY
Get out of here!
JERRY
You get out of here!
JERRY
Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.
JERRY
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
JERRY
Hey, I love a good caper.
JERRY
Well, I've been looking forward to it.
JERRY
Eh, people, people are talking.
JERRY
Non smoking would be great.
JERRY
Thank you. (Throws the towel around like a hot potato.)
JERRY
Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?
JERRY
Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.
JERRY
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
JERRY
Oh, please...
JERRY
Eat something! Babu...
JERRY
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
So?
JERRY
Why not?
JERRY
Statute.
JERRY
Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
JERRY
Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
JERRY
Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
JERRY
It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
JERRY
Babu, you're Pakistani?
JERRY
Babu, may I say something?
JERRY
I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.
JERRY
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
JERRY
Well, not everything. I do what I can.
JERRY
Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
JERRY
Of course, I always do.
JERRY
Hey Georgie!
JERRY
How did you do on the IQ test?!
JERRY
What?!!
JERRY
Well, well, well...
JERRY
Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
JERRY
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...
JERRY
But an 85?
JERRY
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
JERRY
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
JERRY
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
JERRY
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.
JERRY
Babu? Babu...(waves Babu to come to table) Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
JERRY
Well, maybe your refrigerator...
JERRY
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
JERRY
You know what it was, bad location.
JERRY
Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
JERRY
Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY
151?
JERRY
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
JERRY
You know, what would be great?
JERRY
Is he on the plane now?
JERRY
Uh, just my next door neighbor.
JERRY
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
JERRY
What's the matter?
JERRY
Huh? How you feeling?

Well you have to.
JERRY

JERRY
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg
JERRY
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
JERRY
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
JERRY
Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
You're breaking up?
JERRY
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
JERRY
You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after
JERRY
You. I'm talking about people.
JERRY
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
JERRY
Sure.
JERRY
What do you need me for?
JERRY
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's
JERRY
I can't go.
JERRY
Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
JERRY
He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
JERRY
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
JERRY
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of
JERRY
Nah. You two go.
JERRY
Go ahead.
JERRY
I want to but I can't.
JERRY
No.
JERRY
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
JERRY
Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
JERRY
Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from
JERRY
That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on
JERRY
Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
JERRY
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on
JERRY
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not
JERRY
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
JERRY
Really? How late are they open?
JERRY
What?
JERRY
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
JERRY
I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
JERRY
What are you doing?
JERRY
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
JERRY
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said
JERRY
Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
JERRY
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
JERRY
I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
JERRY
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De
JERRY
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go
JERRY
I don't know, regular human time?
JERRY
Why shouldn't I go here?
JERRY
Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
JERRY
So what are calling me six times a day?
JERRY
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
JERRY
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
JERRY
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
JERRY
I don't know what to do.
JERRY
I know, I know.
JERRY
It is kind of silly.
JERRY
I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
JERRY
It's not like she's *in* the movie.
JERRY
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I
JERRY
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level
JERRY
Saving movies.
JERRY
Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
JERRY
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said
JERRY
Oh, hi Ellen.
JERRY
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,
JERRY
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
JERRY
Why don't we just rent a movie?
JERRY
No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,
JERRY
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost
JERRY
You and George got together?
JERRY
Hello.
JERRY
What's up?
JERRY
About what?
JERRY
Too bad.
JERRY
Prognosis Negative.
JERRY
It's not.
JERRY
I have an instinct for these things.
JERRY
Oh, yes you will.
JERRY
Yeah, maybe you won't.
JERRY
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
JERRY
Oh, so there's still hope.
JERRY
Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
JERRY
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should
JERRY
Went out with George, you?
JERRY
How was it? What'd you talk about?
JERRY
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't
JERRY
George too.
JERRY
I've never fixed anybody up.
JERRY
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for
JERRY
Well you implied it.
JERRY
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.
JERRY
He's George!
JERRY
So what?
JERRY
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
JERRY
I went out with you.
JERRY
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run
JERRY
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
JERRY
Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
JERRY
Naturally.
JERRY
Everything.
JERRY
Yeah right.
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
She's good looking.
JERRY
Very good looking.
JERRY
Really very good looking.
JERRY
Yes, I would take her out.
JERRY
What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
JERRY
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
JERRY
Good body, nice body.
JERRY
Nice.
JERRY
Pretty nice.
JERRY
Really very nice and good.
JERRY
Good personality. Funny. Bright.
JERRY
How could she be smarter than you?
JERRY
You know, long dark hair.
JERRY
Flowing?
JERRY
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
JERRY
Just clarifying.
JERRY
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to
JERRY
I think you'll get it out.
JERRY
She's got a fine cheek.
JERRY
A pinkish hue?
JERRY
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her
JERRY
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
JERRY
I think it's tamber.
JERRY
I didn't notice the voice.
JERRY
So, Saturday night.
JERRY
She could have mentioned the conversation.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
JERRY
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
JERRY
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back
JERRY
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. (clicks over) Hello?
JERRY
Oh, hold on. (clicks back) It's George, he just got home.
JERRY
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
JERRY
Of course. (clicks back to George) Yeah, go ahead.
JERRY
You can tell me, I'll vault it.
JERRY
I'm locking the vault. What?
JERRY
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
JERRY
At your apartment?
JERRY
She didn't stay over?
JERRY
So, what did she have to say?
JERRY
He said they had a good time.
JERRY
Oh, good.
JERRY
Nope. You?
JERRY
You sure?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Yeah. Okay then.
JERRY
Goodnight.
JERRY
Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
JERRY
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor
JERRY
I'm gonna call her.
JERRY
No, I'm calling her.
JERRY
No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
JERRY
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
JERRY
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
JERRY
I'll just call her when you leave!
JERRY
It is so my business!
JERRY
Yeah, but--
JERRY
But Kramer--
JERRY
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if
JERRY
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
JERRY
Oh, hi. Soda?
JERRY
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She
JERRY
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
JERRY
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done
JERRY
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
JERRY
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
JERRY
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're
JERRY
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
JERRY
Get your finger out of my face.
JERRY
I don't care.
JERRY
How did you know they were defective?!
JERRY
Acting.
JERRY
Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
JERRY
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
JERRY
So what are these?
JERRY
It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
JERRY
Oh look at this guy.
JERRY
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask
JERRY
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy!
JERRY
Give me that wave!
JERRY
Yeah, I'm free, why?
JERRY
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into
JERRY
What?!
JERRY
Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
JERRY
I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
JERRY
Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
JERRY
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks
JERRY
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
JERRY
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she
JERRY
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
JERRY
Let's not even analyze it.
JERRY
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
JERRY
Friday night.
JERRY
Yep.
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
JERRY
Oh, you dig?
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
JERRY
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for
JERRY
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date
JERRY
What am I drinking, milk?
JERRY
Hi.
JERRY
Thank you.
JERRY
With that?
JERRY
What car?
JERRY
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run.
JERRY
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
JERRY
Yeah, Queens.
JERRY
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that
JERRY
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
JERRY
What?
JERRY
Oh, it was nothing.
JERRY
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the
JERRY
I know a little.
JERRY
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
JERRY
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
JERRY
Australia?
JERRY
But not any more.
JERRY
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
JERRY
We just met.
JERRY
Ask George to go with you.
JERRY
Why do you even need anybody?
JERRY
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very
JERRY
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he
JERRY
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an
JERRY
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's
JERRY
What if she's having an off night?
JERRY
A stupid what?
JERRY
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze,
JERRY
Entertainment Tonight's on.
JERRY
Bedroom.
JERRY
What's it like out?
JERRY
Can I take a sweater?
JERRY
Scarf?
JERRY
What's the matter? What's going on?
JERRY
What is wrong?!
JERRY
Get together?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
What car?
JERRY
Yeah who?
JERRY
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
JERRY
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
JERRY
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to
JERRY
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person
JERRY
How am I going to live with myself?!
JERRY
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
JERRY
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick
JERRY
There should be more people like us.
JERRY
You're telling me.
JERRY
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I
JERRY
Thank you very much.
JERRY
Let me rephra-
JERRY
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
JERRY
Well I think I get the gist of it.
JERRY
What car?
JERRY
It's not complicated.
JERRY
Alright Elaine.
JERRY
It was just a couple of blocks.
JERRY
It's not that hard.
JERRY
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
JERRY
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what
JERRY
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls
JERRY
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the
JERRY
$875?
JERRY
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then
JERRY
Um, who do I make it out to?
JERRY
So, what are you doing this weekend?
JERRY
I didn't do it!
JERRY
You are soo good lookin'.
JERRY
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three
JERRY
Alright!
JERRY
What?!
JERRY
What did I do?
JERRY
I-
JERRY
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
JERRY
No, never.
JERRY
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
JERRY
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
JERRY
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
JERRY
You scared me!
JERRY
That's enough!
JERRY
C'mon...c'mon...
JERRY
Kramer! What are you doing?!
JERRY
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
JERRY
C'mon!
JERRY
Move it! Move it! Get going!
JERRY
Is that my towel?
JERRY
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
JERRY
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
JERRY
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
JERRY
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
JERRY
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
JERRY
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
JERRY
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
JERRY
No, come on!
JERRY
It was sold out!
JERRY
That's the point.
JERRY
Just, look, just give the keys.
JERRY
Don't ask me!
JERRY
I'm telling you.
JERRY
I'm serious!
JERRY
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
JERRY
So put 'em in a safe place.
JERRY
Where?
JERRY
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
JERRY
I can't.
JERRY
Who's there?
JERRY
Elaine...
JERRY
Take the keys.
JERRY
O.K.!
JERRY
Your spare set?
JERRY
You want 'em back?
JERRY
Did you bring the keys?
JERRY
This could be an emergency!
JERRY
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
JERRY
They lost.
JERRY
Kramer?
JERRY
Hello, Newman.
JERRY
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
JERRY
Is he being coy?
JERRY
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
JERRY
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
JERRY
Turn around, George.
JERRY
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
JERRY
Where's Kramer?
JERRY
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
JERRY
Bad rap?
JERRY
Me?
JERRY
L.A.?
JERRY
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
JERRY
Huh?
JERRY
No, what'd you say?
JERRY
Oh, you didn't see it.
JERRY
I heard you say something, there.
JERRY
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
JERRY
She's drunk out of her mind.
JERRY
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
JERRY
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
JERRY
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
JERRY
What is the big deal?
JERRY
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
JERRY
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
JERRY
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
JERRY
Do you wanna fight?
JERRY
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
JERRY
What's that?
JERRY
I heard something.
JERRY
Well, this is great.
JERRY
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
JERRY
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
JERRY
What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
JERRY
By Elaine Benes?
JERRY
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
JERRY
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
JERRY
All right, here!
JERRY
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
JERRY
What? What?
JERRY
It was funny!
JERRY
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
JERRY
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
JERRY
I did not!
JERRY
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
JERRY
Good!
JERRY
And I don't want you to hold mine!
JERRY
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
JERRY
Is that something you want to do?
JERRY
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
JERRY
What did you say?
JERRY
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
JERRY
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
JERRY
I like the button fly.
JERRY
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking
JERRY
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her
JERRY
There's nothing to get.
JERRY
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer
JERRY
She sees something in him.
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
JERRY
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having
JERRY
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
JERRY
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
JERRY
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
JERRY
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
JERRY
What's this?
JERRY
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going
JERRY
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
JERRY
Is he okay?
JERRY
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you
JERRY
How you feeling?
JERRY
(pointing) There's George!
JERRY
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap
JERRY
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we
JERRY
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
JERRY
That's what she told me!
JERRY
That's what it costs!
JERRY
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
JERRY
Well, she framed it and everything.
JERRY
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some-
JERRY
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
JERRY
(reading note) Oh my god!
JERRY
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
JERRY
Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there,
JERRY
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not
JERRY
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about
JERRY
Should I?
JERRY
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
JERRY
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter-
JERRY
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love
JERRY
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away
JERRY
Yeah?
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
...Yeah.
JERRY
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
HUGE pop-in guy!
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Okay!
JERRY
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
JERRY
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back)
JERRY
Let go!
JERRY
Let go, Elaine!
JERRY
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
JERRY
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little
JERRY
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV
JERRY
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
JERRY
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness
JERRY
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She cop-
JERRY
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!
JERRY
How's it coming?
JERRY
Seen any good movies lately?
JERRY
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil
JERRY
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh...
JERRY
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night.
JERRY
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
JERRY
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can
JERRY
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book
JERRY
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour.
JERRY
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer
JERRY
It doesn't work like that.
JERRY
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly
JERRY
That orange dress is burned in my memory
JERRY
I wonder what ever happened to her.
JERRY
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is
JERRY
It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
JERRY
(to speaker) Coming down.
JERRY
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
JERRY
Where's George
JERRY
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.
JERRY
This woman's completely ignoring me.
JERRY
Eventually a little shot of penicillin
JERRY
Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
JERRY
Can I speak with this Bookman?
JERRY
What?
JERRY
Who?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
(whispers) Are you sure?
JERRY
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
JERRY
Oh, he sang like a canary.
JERRY
Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
JERRY
Well what am I supposed to do now?
JERRY
All right Thanks. Come on lets go
JERRY
So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
JERRY
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps
JERRY
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
JERRY
Echh
JERRY
He got fired the next day.
JERRY
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the
JERRY
Well what do girls do ?
JERRY
Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would
JERRY
Coffee?
JERRY
No, I don't drink coffee.
JERRY
No, I don't have--
JERRY
Well, I don't normally--
JERRY
I don't.
JERRY
Really? I'll have to remember that.
JERRY
Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
JERRY
Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very
JERRY
I try.
JERRY
No, I don't.
JERRY
Certainly not.
JERRY
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I have a witness
JERRY
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
JERRY
Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
JERRY
No Black Jack?
JERRY
Tropic of Cancer.
JERRY
Tropic of Capricorn?
JERRY
Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
JERRY
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
JERRY
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
JERRY
It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.
JERRY
Maybe you're getting' a raise.
JERRY
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
JERRY
I'm right here.
JERRY
Columbus, Euro trash.
JERRY
That was double overtime.
JERRY
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
JERRY
Because I gave it to you.
JERRY
Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally
JERRY
Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
JERRY
All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
JERRY
Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
JERRY
What is your problem?
JERRY
(after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine)
JERRY
Oh, beautiful did he like them?
JERRY
(to George) Was he out there?
JERRY
I guess we'll never know.
JERRY
George.
JERRY
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
JERRY
So you have no car?
JERRY
So what good are you?
JERRY
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,
JERRY
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the
JERRY
Yeah, right.
JERRY
He's definitely in Chicago.
JERRY
How would we do it?
JERRY
Maybe he knows O'Brien?
JERRY
What if we get caught?
JERRY
Who's gonna be O'Brien?
JERRY
Who am I?
JERRY
Just me?
JERRY
Okay.
JERRY
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
JERRY
Dylan Murphy.
JERRY
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
JERRY
You could be Colin.
JERRY
I'm Dylan Murphy.
JERRY
Come on,
JERRY
Colin?
JERRY
What for?
JERRY
She happy for you?
JERRY
No. Why?
JERRY
He can't hear us.
JERRY
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my
JERRY
What?
JERRY
We're going to the Knick game!
JERRY
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
JERRY
Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
JERRY
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I
JERRY
Maybe it's a shortcut.
JERRY
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
JERRY
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
JERRY
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now?
JERRY
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
JERRY
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
JERRY
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
JERRY
I'm Seinfeld!
JERRY
We're doing sixty miles an hour!
JERRY
Who are you, Mannix?
JERRY
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
JERRY
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
JERRY
Newsletter?
JERRY
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never
JERRY
Never seen a picture of him?
JERRY
Not even on the book jacket?
JERRY
Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
JERRY
I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
JERRY
He tends to exaggerate.
JERRY
Well you might as well look it over.
JERRY
You're not going to open with that, are you?
JERRY
Nice looking Lugar.
JERRY
What's taking him so long out there?
JERRY
She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
JERRY
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
JERRY
Let's just make a run for it.
JERRY
How'd that happen?
JERRY
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your
JERRY
I don't know.
JERRY
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
JERRY
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
JERRY
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen.
JERRY
We were right on the border.
JERRY
Get in the car! Get in the car!
JERRY
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
JERRY
I met her on an elevator.
JERRY
Impossible, right?
JERRY
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The
JERRY
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
JERRY
Can you believe I did that?
JERRY
Not a good sign.
JERRY
You got something in your teeth there.
JERRY
It's green.
JERRY
Did you bump into anybody you knew?
JERRY
How'd it go?
JERRY
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
JERRY
What's the matter?
JERRY
What?
JERRY
Too late for that.
JERRY
Yeah, she's got a big nose.
JERRY
It's a schnoz.
JERRY
A little.
JERRY
Stop being so concerned with looks.
JERRY
Have you said anything to her about it?
JERRY
Alright, shut up, here they come.
JERRY
Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
JERRY
We have time.
JERRY
It is exciting.
JERRY
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever
JERRY
Then what?
JERRY
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting
JERRY
I don't want to see this woman anymore but
JERRY
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
JERRY
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was
JERRY
It's not like that at all.
JERRY
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
JERRY
Shouldn't a doctor do it?
JERRY
Great job.
JERRY
Let's put him over here.
JERRY
Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
JERRY
You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
JERRY
Give it to me!
JERRY
Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
JERRY
I was lying, give it to me!
JERRY
I want that number!
JERRY
I'm Nelson!
JERRY
Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just
JERRY
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
JERRY
Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
JERRY
Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
JERRY
So I assume the jig was up.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
JERRY
You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would
JERRY
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. 
JERRY
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in
JERRY
He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next
JERRY
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. And
JERRY
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
JERRY
No no. I'm just saying.
JERRY
I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the
JERRY
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
JERRY
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
JERRY
I'm in the middle of a story.
JERRY
Not like it's a really funny story or anything.
JERRY
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and the for some reason I
JERRY
Yes, it was.
JERRY
I know it was stupid.
JERRY
Hey, I just said it was stupid.
JERRY
Take it.
JERRY
Hey, would you stop it already?
JERRY
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
JERRY
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Not if you have a doctor's note.
JERRY
Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could
JERRY
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little
JERRY
No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about
JERRY
What's with you?
JERRY
Yes, A...?
JERRY
Yes, a man gave you...?
JERRY
So?
JERRY
He was what?!
JERRY
That's a massage.
JERRY
You took your pants off?
JERRY
Oh.
JERRY
Really?
JERRY
Moved?
JERRY
I'm sure it didn't move.
JERRY
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other
JERRY
Okay, so what if it moved?
JERRY
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of
JERRY
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
JERRY
I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant
JERRY
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy
JERRY
He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.
JERRY
I never said I'd do that.
JERRY
I don't know how I feel about it.
JERRY
Alright, alright.
JERRY
...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write
JERRY
I mean, if you feel funny about it at all.
JERRY
If he does.
JERRY
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
JERRY
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
JERRY
What is the matter with you?
JERRY
You don't have to, really.
JERRY
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to
JERRY
Well what about the week after? No appointments at all? (Jerry tries
JERRY
Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
JERRY
Uh huh.
JERRY
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
JERRY
What happened to you?
JERRY
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god, how did this happen? What can I
JERRY
I told you.
JERRY
I told you we shouldn't do it.
JERRY
He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You
JERRY
Yeah, you, me and George.
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
You what?
JERRY
Why'd you do that?
JERRY
Of course I was getting you a note.
JERRY
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from
JERRY
Hi Pam.
JERRY
I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy.
JERRY
Hi Roy.
JERRY
I don't even know what to say.
JERRY
I knew this would happen.
JERRY
I mean the whole thing, it's just...
JERRY
Well it's not tragic.
JERRY
No, it's...
JERRY
Okay. I mean, what if the--
JERRY
I'm not happy.
JERRY
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not now.
JERRY
Yeah, college was fun.
JERRY
Oh please, I love her.
JERRY
What's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
JERRY
What? The physical therapist? Why?
JERRY
Hi. Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important
JERRY
Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really have to speak with her.
JERRY
You don't understand.
JERRY
Wait a second, don't you-- (Julianna walks up with her child) Hi. Hi. 
JERRY
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is
JERRY
Can't you just listen to me?
JERRY
The police?
JERRY
Raymond?
JERRY
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
JERRY
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention) 
JERRY
Did he say anything?
JERRY
Oh my god, it's...
JERRY
Having a cup of coffee.
JERRY
Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. Here.
JERRY
Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
JERRY
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
JERRY
Big accomplishment. GEORGE Fish. What do they do?
JERRY
Five o'clock.
JERRY
You're not late.
JERRY
Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
JERRY
There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
JERRY
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
JERRY
You want me to help you with that?
JERRY
(TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
JERRY
Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
JERRY
Where's the car?
JERRY
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
JERRY
It's over there. I know where it is.
JERRY
There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
JERRY
Hmmm...I thought it was...
JERRY
I thought it was over there.
JERRY
I really have to go to the bathroom.
JERRY
I'll wait.
JERRY
Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
JERRY
Will you let me help you with that?
JERRY
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
JERRY
Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
JERRY
Maybe it's not on this level.
JERRY
There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
JERRY
You should always carry a pad and pen. GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
JERRY
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
JERRY
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
JERRY
His eyes look a little cloudy.
JERRY
Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
JERRY
No one's going to do that.
JERRY
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
JERRY
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
JERRY
I know.
JERRY
No I can't.
JERRY
You think I'm too cautious?
JERRY
Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
JERRY
He's a comedian.
JERRY
All right. All right.
JERRY
I can manage.
JERRY
Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
JERRY
But...
JERRY
...Kramer
JERRY
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
JERRY
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
JERRY
So you don't care if I die.
JERRY
It was life and death.
JERRY
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
JERRY
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
JERRY
Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
JERRY
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
JERRY
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
JERRY
And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
JERRY
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
JERRY
What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
JERRY
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
JERRY
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
JERRY
I was arrested for urinating.
JERRY
I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
JERRY
No, but he's not looking good...
JERRY
Hey, where's Kramer?
JERRY
Hey George, there she is again. ...
JERRY
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
JERRY
Filthy pigs.
JERRY
Jerry.
JERRY
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
JERRY
The car!
JERRY
Kramer!
JERRY
Kramer.
JERRY
Yeah, over here.
JERRY
What are you talking about?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Oh yeah, I know.
JERRY
What's the difference?
JERRY
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
JERRY
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
JERRY
You have to know, you must know.
JERRY
Well, I'm not telling you.
JERRY
Nope. I don't think so.
JERRY
Not today, pal.
JERRY
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put
JERRY
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
JERRY
I loaned the car to George.
JERRY
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
JERRY
Huh?
JERRY
Will you stop it already?!
JERRY
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
JERRY
*I* don't like you!
JERRY
Why not?
JERRY
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
JERRY
No, I like Mike.
JERRY
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
JERRY
Oh yeah? What did he say?
JERRY
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
JERRY
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
JERRY
Please, don't make me beg.
JERRY
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
JERRY
Kramer!
JERRY
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
JERRY
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the
JERRY
He what?
JERRY
A phony? He called me a phony?
JERRY
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
JERRY
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
JERRY
Tell me what happened.
JERRY
He is?
JERRY
A gun?!
JERRY
My god, are you okay?
JERRY
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
JERRY
Where's George now?
JERRY
What are you talking about?
JERRY
Hey Georgie!
JERRY
Are you okay?
JERRY
Crazy kids, huh?
JERRY
Oh, hey Mike.
JERRY
I'm coming down.
JERRY
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
JERRY
Yeah, he's a real phony.
JERRY
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
JERRY
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much
JERRY
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
JERRY
I didn't know.
JERRY
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
JERRY
You're right. My fault.
JERRY
It was a so-so sorry.
JERRY
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
JERRY
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
JERRY
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
JERRY
What did you do to my car?!
JERRY
I thought you said you were a good driver!
JERRY
I think you said driver.
JERRY
Hey Sid.
JERRY
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The
JERRY
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
JERRY
Hey Matthew.
JERRY
How ya doing?
JERRY
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
JERRY
Oh no, nothing.
JERRY
No, no, no, no.
JERRY
No, of course not, of course not!
JERRY
I didn't--
JERRY
Hey, do you think I'm phony?
JERRY
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
JERRY
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell
JERRY
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
JERRY
Open my vault?
JERRY
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
JERRY
Oy ga-vault.
JERRY
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs,
JERRY
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
JERRY
I still don't have to go.
JERRY
Why? I'll tell you why.
JERRY
Like you didn't call me a phony?
JERRY
Use it in a sentence.
JERRY
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
JERRY
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
JERRY
Hey, there's the old man! (hug)
JERRY
We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
JERRY
What's the difference?
JERRY
I don't wanna use your car.
JERRY
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
JERRY
So what would you do? You'd hitch?
JERRY
I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
JERRY
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
JERRY
You're not paying for it.
JERRY
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
JERRY
It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
JERRY
(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
JERRY
The lake isn't real.
JERRY
I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
JERRY
Ma.
JERRY
(to Morty) What about you?
JERRY
(to Helen) What about him?
JERRY
No that's not such a good idea.
JERRY
Not now. She's right inside.
JERRY
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
JERRY
Well...
JERRY
Shh! Nothing, nothing.
JERRY
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.
JERRY
I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
JERRY
I'm going for the record.
JERRY
Oh, come on.
JERRY
Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.
JERRY
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
JERRY
For fun.
JERRY
I don't think so.
JERRY
What kind of pen is that?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
JERRY
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works.
JERRY
Oh no.
JERRY
I couldn't
JERRY
I can't take it.
JERRY
No, I'm not...
JERRY
I cannot take it!
JERRY
Are you sure?
JERRY
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
JERRY
Thanks again.
JERRY
What he gave it to me.
JERRY
He offered it to me.
JERRY
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
JERRY
He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
JERRY
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
JERRY
Well, he was wrong.
JERRY
So you want me to return it?
JERRY
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
JERRY
Are you O.K. in here?
JERRY
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
JERRY
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
JERRY
Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.
JERRY
They're nuts with temperature.
JERRY
How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
JERRY
It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
JERRY
Stay on Biscayne.
JERRY
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
JERRY
What's so special up here?
JERRY
Then YOU would be hunched over.
JERRY
You can't go?
JERRY
Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
JERRY
You sure?
JERRY
We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
JERRY
Why don't you get a new sofa?
JERRY
I'm buying you a new sofa.
JERRY
Hi. How are you?
JERRY
Evelyn, this is Elaine.
JERRY
Too thin?
JERRY
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
JERRY
I never really wanted the pen.
JERRY
No, no, I...
JERRY
All I said was "I like the pen".
JERRY
Don't be alarmed.
JERRY
I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
JERRY
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
JERRY
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
JERRY
Well I started to go under...
JERRY
Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
JERRY
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
JERRY
Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JERRY
I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he tends the pen to Jack)
JERRY
Take it.
JERRY
What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
JERRY
Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
JERRY
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
JERRY
(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
JERRY
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
JERRY
(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
JERRY
I've got a black eye.
JERRY
Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
JERRY
(to Stella) Her back hurts.
JERRY
No, no.
JERRY
Dad!
JERRY
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
JERRY
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
JERRY
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
JERRY
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
JERRY
All I said was I liked the pen!
JERRY
There must be some mistake.
JERRY
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
JERRY
Nothing.
JERRY
Hi Evelyn.
JERRY
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
JERRY
Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
JERRY
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
JERRY
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
JERRY
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
JERRY
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the
JERRY
Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
JERRY
That smells good, what is that?
JERRY
The beach?
JERRY
You joined the Polar Bears?!
JERRY
Yeah... So's shock therapy.
JERRY
(with glee) What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
JERRY
You don't know?
JERRY
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
JERRY
Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you
JERRY
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
JERRY
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
JERRY
(quickly whispering) I resent that you said that! That's
JERRY
Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
JERRY
I dunno, it was an impulse.
JERRY
How could I know she would start to laugh?
JERRY
Can we just go in already?
JERRY
What about?
JERRY
I know, but I'm distracted now.
JERRY
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
JERRY
"Cut to the chase"?
JERRY
What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
JERRY
I would lose that.
JERRY
"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
JERRY
Really, an intervention ...
JERRY
Me? Why me?
JERRY
Y'know these things are really hard to load...
JERRY
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
JERRY
You play a Hell of a piano.
JERRY
Pez?
JERRY
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
JERRY
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
JERRY
We'll be outside
JERRY
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
JERRY
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
JERRY
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.
JERRY
What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,
JERRY
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
JERRY
He's the same!
JERRY
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for
JERRY
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
JERRY
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
JERRY
Yeah
JERRY
Yeah, but John invited her.
JERRY
No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
JERRY
Stop smelling your arm.
JERRY
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
JERRY
Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.
JERRY
She broke up with you?
JERRY
What was on the list?
JERRY
Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
JERRY
What's wrong with lunch?
JERRY
A preemptive breakup.
JERRY
In the freezer.
JERRY
Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
Intervention.
JERRY
No, we're having an intervention
JERRY
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
JERRY
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
JERRY
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
JERRY
We're having the intervention for Richie.
JERRY
Well, uh..
JERRY
Well, you're looking well.
JERRY
I didn't know she would laugh.
JERRY
Hey Richie
JERRY
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's
JERRY
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
JERRY
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's
JERRY
Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control
JERRY
So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
JERRY
What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
JERRY
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.
JERRY
I can't do those things.
JERRY
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
JERRY
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
JERRY
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
JERRY
I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
JERRY
It was a gift.
JERRY
If they like each other.
JERRY
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
JERRY
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
JERRY
You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
JERRY
Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
JERRY
I think it's off the wagon.
JERRY
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
JERRY
Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
JERRY
Under the sofa cushion.
JERRY
It's your Christmas present.
JERRY
"The guy?"
JERRY
Cranberry juice?
JERRY
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
JERRY
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
JERRY
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
JERRY
Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
JERRY
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
JERRY
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
JERRY
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
JERRY
Yeah. She would love cashmere.
JERRY
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
JERRY
Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
JERRY
It's hard to say.
JERRY
Well I can see it.
JERRY
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
JERRY
It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
JERRY
You want me to take an overview?
JERRY
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
JERRY
Yeah so?
JERRY
Oh boy, can you smell it?
JERRY
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
JERRY
Yes you do.
JERRY
Yes you would.
JERRY
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
JERRY
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
JERRY
I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
JERRY
I don't smell anything.
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
JERRY
I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
JERRY
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
JERRY
I don't know.
JERRY
Ahem. Say that again?
JERRY
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
JERRY
Now what did you ask me again.
JERRY
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
JERRY
Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
JERRY
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
JERRY
Convulsing?
JERRY
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
JERRY
You don't drink.
JERRY
So you started drinking.
JERRY
So how was it?
JERRY
Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
JERRY
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
JERRY
What are you saying?
JERRY
You're saying something.
JERRY
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
JERRY
Well why don't you say it?
JERRY
What did you say?
JERRY
Yeah?
JERRY
Come on up.
JERRY
No I didn't.
JERRY
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
JERRY
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
JERRY
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
JERRY
No.
JERRY
I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
JERRY
No.
JERRY
I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
JERRY
I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
JERRY
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
JERRY
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
JERRY
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
JERRY
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
JERRY
I know enough not to get on them.
JERRY
George?
JERRY
George?
JERRY
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
JERRY
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
JERRY
Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
JERRY
Get off of me.
JERRY
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
JERRY
Don't get smart.
JERRY
How did you get fleas?
JERRY
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
JERRY
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The
JERRY
Who?
JERRY
Nah.
JERRY
Oh, well, now you're talking.
JERRY
What does that mean, good dip?
JERRY
There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in
JERRY
Got it.
JERRY
I got isobutane-20.
JERRY
You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?
JERRY
I have aloe!
JERRY
Where do they make yours?
JERRY
White Plains.
JERRY
Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one
JERRY
Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.
JERRY
No, let's survey first.  Camp here.
JERRY
What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of
JERRY
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
JERRY
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us
JERRY
Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no,
JERRY
Yeah, yeah I did.
JERRY
I'm a comedian.
JERRY
I hear a voice.
JERRY
A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
JERRY
It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.
JERRY
Great, how about you?
JERRY
How do you account for this?
JERRY
Well, she obviously liked you all along.
JERRY
Anyway, I'm ready to go.
JERRY
If not now, when?
JERRY
Okay, half-hour.
JERRY
Can I talk to you for a second?
JERRY
Hey, I was dying over there.
JERRY
Right.
JERRY
You ready?
JERRY
I do favors.
JERRY
What?
JERRY
Wow.
JERRY
Go!  What could you do?
JERRY
We'll get a ride.
JERRY
We'll be fine, what did she say?
JERRY
What?  She said that?
JERRY
Get out of here.
JERRY
What did you say?
JERRY
What did you say?
JERRY
What?
JERRY
I long for you?
JERRY
It's okay, that's not bad.
JERRY
Really?
JERRY
Oh, come on.
JERRY
George, you're thinking too much.
JERRY
Pendant?  Those bastards.
JERRY
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
JERRY
Uh, no, he's taking the car.
JERRY
I don't know.
JERRY
Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
JERRY
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
JERRY
Yeah, yeah, alright.
JERRY
Just don't make a scene.
JERRY
Oh boy.
JERRY
Here we go.
JERRY
You're beautiful.
JERRY
Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?
JERRY
Can I use your phone?
JERRY
A bigger bill?
JERRY
Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long
JERRY
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
JERRY
I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
JERRY
Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw
JERRY
Thousand.
JERRY
Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?
JERRY
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike
JERRY
Oh, he's coming.
JERRY
That's him.
JERRY
Thanks, great party.
JERRY
Hey, it's okay.
JERRY
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you
JERRY
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy
JERRY
Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.
JERRY
George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour,
JERRY
Who is it?
JERRY
Who?
JERRY
Do I know you?
JERRY
I'm sorry, uh-
JERRY
Oh, okay.
JERRY
You certainly are.  What's going on?
JERRY
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
JERRY
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
JERRY
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
JERRY
No, it's-
JERRY
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
JERRY
Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.
JERRY
They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I
JERRY
Oh, come on.
JERRY
I've never had a job.
JERRY
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
JERRY
What are you gonna do?
JERRY
Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.
JERRY
Nine sixty.
JERRY
Why?
JERRY
What do you mean, you got it?
JERRY
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing?  You're
JERRY
You're a lunatic.
JERRY
What do you say to a person like you?
JERRY
Oh.
JERRY
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
JERRY
What the hell?
JERRY
Nice to meet you.
JERRY
What the hell is going on here?
JERRY
Oh, Kramer huh?
JERRY
Patti?
JERRY
Alright, how much does he owe you?
JERRY
Fifty dollars.
JERRY
Yeah, but--
JERRY
Wait a second, I--
JERRY
Oh boy.
JERRY
He was a nice guy.
JERRY
Was there a red-headed guy there?
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.
JERRY
Oh, we all hated him.
JERRY
Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
JERRY
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of
JERRY
What time is the lesbian wedding?
JERRY
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
JERRY
Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
JERRY
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of
JERRY
So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I
JERRY
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was
JERRY
So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on
JERRY
All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
JERRY
Kramer, bumper-cars?
JERRY
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to
JERRY
O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
JERRY
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
JERRY
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends,
JERRY
All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a
JERRY
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up
JERRY
That's your problem, you should be.
JERRY
Don't get up, please, allow me.
JERRY
First we ride the cyclone.
JERRY
Aah, French fries.
JERRY
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the
JERRY
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at
JERRY
You want him?
JERRY
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
JERRY
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
JERRY
Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
JERRY
Come on, I'll go with you.
JERRY
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
JERRY
What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
JERRY
I think I'll take out the garbage.
JERRY
Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.
JERRY
Come on, it's just down the hall.
JERRY
I'll give you 50 cents.
JERRY
Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake
JERRY
I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
JERRY
Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.
JERRY
Hi.
JERRY
Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?
JERRY
How much do they cost?
JERRY
No, no the junior.
JERRY
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?
JERRY
Boy she's sexy isn't she?
JERRY
Do you believe that guy?
JERRY
My neighbour:
JERRY
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
JERRY
What's so amazing? You've seen him before.
JERRY
What was the dream?
JERRY
I think I've played there.
JERRY
You're a little paranormal
JERRY
Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
JERRY
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
JERRY
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
JERRY
Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
JERRY
Who is it? Who is it?
JERRY
Who?
JERRY
Martine?
JERRY
Oh, Martin!
JERRY
What?
JERRY
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
JERRY
It'll take two seconds.
JERRY
We don't have two seconds?
JERRY
Nah, forget it.
JERRY
Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.
JERRY
Are you sure?
JERRY
Nah, I'll go get the robe.
JERRY
That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
JERRY
Really? It's over?
JERRY
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
JERRY
He said that?
JERRY
I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
JERRY
You weren't?
JERRY
Of course.
JERRY
Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
JERRY
I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.
JERRY
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
JERRY
No.
JERRY
Here?
JERRY
Is this the proper venue?
JERRY
No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
JERRY
I can't. What if he wakes up?
JERRY
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it.
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
Yeah, I heard.
JERRY
Who told you about Martin?
JERRY
Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
JERRY
You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
JERRY
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
JERRY
So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
JERRY
Nothing.
JERRY
I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.
JERRY
So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
JERRY
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?
JERRY
You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
JERRY
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
JERRY
They're a comedy team.
JERRY
Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
JERRY
I will show you The Stooges.
JERRY
Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
JERRY
Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
JERRY
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
JERRY
Yeah, all right. All right.
JERRY
Hello Newman.
JERRY
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
JERRY
Boy, it's a good thing we came.
JERRY
George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
JERRY
Looters.
JERRY
She's really hungry.
JERRY
Hello.
JERRY
How's he doing?
JERRY
Why wouldn't he?
JERRY
He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
JERRY
How up to date?
JERRY
And nothing could change your mind?
JERRY
Drake's Coffee Cake
JERRY
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
JERRY
That's your big boy.
JERRY
I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later.
JERRY
I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile.
JERRY
You swear?
JERRY
On your mother's life?
JERRY
Elaine! No! No!
JERRY
Hey!
JERRY
What are you doing? We're going out to dinner in ten minutes.
JERRY
What did she name the kid?
JERRY
Hey.
JERRY
osh.
JERRY
Woah. (hitting George)
JERRY
Wow! (hitting George)
JERRY
Oh! (hitting George)
JERRY
Oh! (hitting George)
JERRY
Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
JERRY
Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
JERRY
Yeah, it's some place down in the village.
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
All right we're coming down.
JERRY
We're taking Elaine to dinner. She's got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
JERRY
....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant?
JERRY
Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
JERRY
Oh! well whatever you have to do.
JERRY
(sarcastically) No you don't..
JERRY
My show from last night.
JERRY
Yeah , I was doing new material.
JERRY
Huh?
JERRY
The" coup dé-toe"
JERRY
Yeah!
JERRY
Nothin'.....nothing at all.
JERRY
Who you calling?
JERRY
China really?
JERRY
What for?
JERRY
Hair?
JERRY
Done what?
JERRY
( to Kramer) What's this?
JERRY
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
JERRY
Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to
JERRY
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
JERRY
It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
JERRY
Good question.
JERRY
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
JERRY
Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
JERRY
(pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
JERRY
The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
JERRY
No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
JERRY
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf.( leaves table)
JERRY
Remember Peter?
JERRY
You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this
JERRY
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
JERRY
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults.
JERRY
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
JERRY
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
JERRY
Sure.
JERRY
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
JERRY
Why are you doing this?
JERRY
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
JERRY
You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
JERRY
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed
JERRY
( as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me ( Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
JERRY
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye.
JERRY
That's my cockney accent.
JERRY
Lets hear yours.
JERRY
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I
JERRY
Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
JERRY
Yes I am skeptical.
JERRY
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
JERRY
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
JERRY
Yeah.
JERRY
No kidding?
