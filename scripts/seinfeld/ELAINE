ELAINE
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading
ELAINE
Well, he's not a baseball player.
ELAINE
Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
ELAINE
He's sixty-six years old.
ELAINE
Well, go, go.
ELAINE
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd
ELAINE
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm
ELAINE
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
ELAINE
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
ELAINE
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being
ELAINE
I just don't enjoy being with him.
ELAINE
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to
ELAINE
Seven?
ELAINE
Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
ELAINE
Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
ELAINE
Today?!
ELAINE
Yeah.

He was laughing?!
ELAINE
Get out!
ELAINE
So was Mia Farrow there?

ELAINE
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
ELAINE
I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
ELAINE
Call an ambulance.
ELAINE
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about
ELAINE
Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
ELAINE
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance,
ELAINE
What extremities?
ELAINE
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
ELAINE
Well use a paper towel.
ELAINE
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
ELAINE
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the
ELAINE
He is not a drug addict!
ELAINE
A cookie!
ELAINE
How's he gonna chew it?
ELAINE
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
ELAINE
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink
ELAINE
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
ELAINE
Where is the ambulance?!
ELAINE
I can't believe what's going on out here.
ELAINE
He seems to be breathing.
ELAINE
I know.
ELAINE
Almost.
ELAINE
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
ELAINE
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
ELAINE
He does, how'd you know that?
ELAINE
What happened, what took you so long?!
ELAINE
This guy I'm seeing.
ELAINE
Cookies?
ELAINE
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with
ELAINE
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy
ELAINE
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll
ELAINE
Of course there's a community.
ELAINE
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't
ELAINE
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a
ELAINE
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today,
ELAINE
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for

Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.

No,

Dinner's good.
ELAINE

ELAINE
Why?
ELAINE
What was it?
ELAINE
Wow! What a story.

So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.

ELAINE
You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
ELAINE
It's your house.
ELAINE
Casus belli.
ELAINE
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
ELAINE
Have you gone in there?
ELAINE
Sure, fine.
ELAINE
Casus belli.
ELAINE
Since when do you wear cologne?
ELAINE
What IQ test?
ELAINE
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
ELAINE
Oh, that sounds like fun.
ELAINE
You'll do well, you're smart.
ELAINE
What did you get on your SAT's?
ELAINE
Mine's 145.
ELAINE
You get out of here!
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Are you serious?
ELAINE
Where would I take the test?

No, that would be too noisy.
ELAINE
Hey, what do you think?
ELAINE
Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.
ELAINE
What the hey.
ELAINE
What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.

ELAINE
You're very special.
ELAINE
Just give it back to him.

ELAINE
He's coming up?
ELAINE
Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.
ELAINE
George, I cannot believe...
ELAINE
No there has got be a mistake.
ELAINE
There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
ELAINE
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
ELAINE
Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?

ELAINE
What's going on?
ELAINE
Why did you come in here for?
ELAINE
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.

What's the difference?!!
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Well eh, kind of....
ELAINE
Oh.
ELAINE
Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
ELAINE
Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...(Monica closes the window)...entreat.
ELAINE
Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
ELAINE
No, Chinese.
ELAINE
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
ELAINE
If only.
ELAINE
Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
ELAINE
Do you pick it up?
ELAINE
You pick it up?!?
ELAINE
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
ELAINE
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
ELAINE
No, milk.
ELAINE
What is a bender anyhow?
ELAINE
I can't believe he hasn't called.
ELAINE
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
ELAINE
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant
ELAINE
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
ELAINE
Just me and George?
ELAINE
But we need you.
ELAINE
Because... Yeah?
ELAINE
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law.
ELAINE
Just me and George alone?
ELAINE
Do you?
ELAINE
It's up to you.
ELAINE
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,
ELAINE
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean
ELAINE
I know, it's not that.
ELAINE
About three years.
ELAINE
Hmm.
ELAINE
Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same
ELAINE
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
ELAINE
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
ELAINE
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he
ELAINE
No.
ELAINE
I know!
ELAINE
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many
ELAINE
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of
ELAINE
Do you have to?
ELAINE
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
ELAINE
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them
ELAINE
What is it?
ELAINE
Ohhhhh, that's great.
ELAINE
Terrific.
ELAINE
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
ELAINE
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
ELAINE
Kramer, we like her.
ELAINE
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
ELAINE
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
ELAINE
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the
ELAINE
We'll see it Sunday.
ELAINE
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
ELAINE
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
Who's stopping you?
ELAINE
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
ELAINE
Good. Good. You?
ELAINE
Boy, he takes such a long time.
ELAINE
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
ELAINE
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
ELAINE
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,
ELAINE
We talked about that already.
ELAINE
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with!
ELAINE
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my
ELAINE
We made plans.
ELAINE
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
ELAINE
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
ELAINE
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
ELAINE
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
ELAINE
I thought she was the one.
ELAINE
Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
ELAINE
I know.
ELAINE
I hate the good ones.
ELAINE
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
ELAINE
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
ELAINE
Well, at least you're not bitter.
ELAINE
Aren't you too young to be bitter?
ELAINE
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
ELAINE
So what'd you do last night?
ELAINE
Went out with Cynthia.
ELAINE
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest.
ELAINE
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
ELAINE
Yeah, right.
ELAINE
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
ELAINE
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
ELAINE
I didn't say it.
ELAINE
Who is he?
ELAINE
She's Cynthia!
ELAINE
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
ELAINE
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
ELAINE
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,
ELAINE
He can really do that?
ELAINE
What, are you into this?
ELAINE
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how
ELAINE
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean
ELAINE
What if it worked out?
ELAINE
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
ELAINE
Well, um, he, he got fired.
ELAINE
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
ELAINE
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems
ELAINE
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
ELAINE
Pardon?
ELAINE
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short.
ELAINE
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up
ELAINE
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
ELAINE
Yup.
ELAINE
No.
ELAINE
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
ELAINE
Yeah, he did.
ELAINE
Hi.
ELAINE
I know!
ELAINE
She said you're getting together Saturday night!
ELAINE
Yeah!
ELAINE
No.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
ELAINE
I think they went out to dinner.
ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
ELAINE
Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
ELAINE
Oh my god.
ELAINE
So? How was it?
ELAINE
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
ELAINE
Yeah, ok. (clicks over) Hello?
ELAINE
What did he have to say?
ELAINE
Her too.
ELAINE
Anything else?
ELAINE
Nope.
ELAINE
Yup. You?
ELAINE
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
ELAINE
Alright. Goodnight.
ELAINE
Oh my god.
ELAINE
But he used a condom, right?
ELAINE
Oh no.
ELAINE
Was it blue?
ELAINE
Just a hunch.
ELAINE
No thanks.
ELAINE
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's
ELAINE
Her type? What type?
ELAINE
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
ELAINE
She's not bitter!
ELAINE
Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
ELAINE
Are you calling me a liar?
ELAINE
Are you?
ELAINE
You get yours out, I was here first!
ELAINE
Get it out!
ELAINE
I knew those condoms were defective!
ELAINE
Because! Because she missed her period!
ELAINE
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
ELAINE
Hi!
ELAINE
What happened?
ELAINE
Very mature.
ELAINE
Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
ELAINE
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the
ELAINE
What's goin' on?
ELAINE
Did you get a thank you wave?
ELAINE
Jerry, are you free on Friday?
ELAINE
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have
ELAINE
You gotta follow that car!
ELAINE
You can't let him get away with that!
ELAINE
What are you, yellow?
ELAINE
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
ELAINE
What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
ELAINE
It's me!
ELAINE
Hey!
ELAINE
Sweater.
ELAINE
So? What happened?
ELAINE
With the car!
ELAINE
The hit and run!
ELAINE
Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
ELAINE
So? Then what?
ELAINE
I am speechless. I am without speech.
ELAINE
What shoving?!
ELAINE
You know karate??
ELAINE
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?
ELAINE
Did you tell Kramer?
ELAINE
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
ELAINE
Hey Kramer, Kramer!
ELAINE
What happened to you right here? (She's pointing to her forehead)
ELAINE
Well, that is, that is strange.
ELAINE
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
ELAINE
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
ELAINE
But I, I can't go alone!
ELAINE
George, come on! I'll pay for you.
ELAINE
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple.
ELAINE
Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
ELAINE
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
ELAINE
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is
ELAINE
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do
ELAINE
It's me.
ELAINE
Hi!
ELAINE
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
ELAINE
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid
ELAINE
Whatever.
ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a
ELAINE
Robin!
ELAINE
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
ELAINE
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
ELAINE
Chilly out.
ELAINE
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
ELAINE
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last
ELAINE
That is it!
ELAINE
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
ELAINE
Are you actually considering this?
ELAINE
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a
ELAINE
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
ELAINE
Hi, Michael!
ELAINE
Robin? No, why?
ELAINE
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter
ELAINE
Well I, I don't know.
ELAINE
No, no, come on Michael!
ELAINE
You're soo good lookin'.
ELAINE
Very nice meeting you!
ELAINE
Come on up.
ELAINE
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening!
ELAINE
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind
ELAINE
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
ELAINE
Oh, did you check you machine?
ELAINE
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
ELAINE
And I said I hadn't seen her.
ELAINE
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was
ELAINE
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
ELAINE
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
ELAINE
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
ELAINE
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have
ELAINE
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
ELAINE
I will.
ELAINE
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
ELAINE
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
ELAINE
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
ELAINE
Oh, I'm not, uh...
ELAINE
Jerry, give him the keys back.
ELAINE
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
ELAINE
That's ridiculous.
ELAINE
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
ELAINE
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
ELAINE
'Cause he gave me his.
ELAINE
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
ELAINE
I just said the same thing to you.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
ELAINE
What's going on?
ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullsh*t.
ELAINE
What...?
ELAINE
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
ELAINE
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
ELAINE
I didn't say anything.
ELAINE
You weasels!
ELAINE
How dare you!
ELAINE
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
ELAINE
Well, it's just a first draft!
ELAINE
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
ELAINE
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
ELAINE
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
ELAINE
And I want my keys back from you!
ELAINE
No, you can't be trusted!
ELAINE
Good! I won't!
ELAINE
These aren't my keys!
ELAINE
I don't know!
ELAINE
I just thought I could write it.
ELAINE
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
ELAINE
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
ELAINE
I didn't say anything.
ELAINE
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
ELAINE
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
ELAINE
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than
ELAINE
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
ELAINE
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to
ELAINE
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father
ELAINE
Hi!
ELAINE
Great, great.
ELAINE
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
ELAINE
You're not serious.
ELAINE
Well, did he say that?
ELAINE
Well maybe you should ask him!
ELAINE
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This
ELAINE
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
ELAINE
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
ELAINE
No!
ELAINE
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
ELAINE
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over
ELAINE
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you
ELAINE
I know! Can you imagine that?
ELAINE
Wha- a picture?
ELAINE
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
ELAINE
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
ELAINE
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father!
ELAINE
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
ELAINE
My, my father?
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
I went to visit him.
ELAINE
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
ELAINE
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have
ELAINE
What--what did I say?
ELAINE
I did?
ELAINE
Oh! Where are you going?
ELAINE
Ah. ...Yeah.
ELAINE
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the
ELAINE
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD
ELAINE
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat)
ELAINE
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
ELAINE

ELAINE
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never

ELAINE
Well at least let George do it!
ELAINE
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
ELAINE
What letter?
ELAINE
You know, it's not really that terrible.
ELAINE
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
ELAINE
Well, uh, fan. My father--
ELAINE
Really?
ELAINE
So... impudent.
ELAINE
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
ELAINE
(very reluctant) Okay.
ELAINE
That will be fun.
ELAINE
Where's Karen?
ELAINE
She didn't ask me what I wanted.
ELAINE
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
ELAINE
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's
ELAINE
Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
ELAINE
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of
ELAINE
It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
ELAINE
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend.
ELAINE
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See,
ELAINE
What did he do?
ELAINE
Come on tell me what happened.
ELAINE
Why do they call it a wedgie?
ELAINE
Boys are sick.
ELAINE
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.
ELAINE
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
ELAINE
Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
George is on his way up.
ELAINE
Are you OK? What? What?
ELAINE
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
ELAINE
Remember that Columbus book?
ELAINE
Him? Him who?
ELAINE
Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
ELAINE
At least it wasn't atomic.
ELAINE
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems.
ELAINE
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
ELAINE
Hey!
ELAINE
Yeah? So?
ELAINE
I'm not telling you.
ELAINE
No!
ELAINE
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I
ELAINE
Just in those commercials.
ELAINE
What's that?
ELAINE
Huh?
ELAINE
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going
ELAINE
He did.
ELAINE
I don't know.
ELAINE
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them
ELAINE
Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
ELAINE
Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
ELAINE
What's going on?
ELAINE
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
ELAINE
Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
ELAINE
I'm sure he was just joking around.
ELAINE
What is it?
ELAINE
Jerry's a nazi?!
ELAINE
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
ELAINE
No, he's just neat.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
What about his comedy act?
ELAINE
What about George?
ELAINE
I'll bet they were even in on it.
ELAINE
Kramer, you're hurting me!
ELAINE
Get off of me!!
ELAINE
It could be very confusing.
ELAINE
Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
ELAINE
Hey!
ELAINE
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
ELAINE
Are you coming with me?
ELAINE
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
ELAINE
Kramer!
ELAINE
How could you say something like that?!
ELAINE
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
ELAINE
What did you have to say that for?
ELAINE
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
ELAINE
Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
ELAINE
You encouraged her to get one.
ELAINE
Peter Jennings had one?
ELAINE
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
ELAINE
I think it's a mistake.
ELAINE
How do you even know the jacket is there?
ELAINE
Are you sure you want us here for this?
ELAINE
It looks good.
ELAINE
How ya feeling?
ELAINE
Can I get you anything?
ELAINE
You sure? Anything?
ELAINE
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
ELAINE
Seems to be.
ELAINE
Shut up, George.
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
What do I need this for?
ELAINE
We're engaged?
ELAINE
Kramer, this is too big.
ELAINE
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father
ELAINE
I heard him contend that.
ELAINE
Oh, it was a frame-up.
ELAINE
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
ELAINE
How kind of you.
ELAINE
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
ELAINE
My father, really? I had no idea.
ELAINE
I found it!
ELAINE
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
ELAINE
Yeah, pretty much.
ELAINE
Hi!
ELAINE
So, will I see you later tonight?
ELAINE
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect
ELAINE
I don't like to talk during a massage.
ELAINE
Oh! I forgot to tell you--
ELAINE
Okay, go ahead.
ELAINE
What happened?
ELAINE
Oh, wasn't that terrible?
ELAINE
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
ELAINE
Really stupid.
ELAINE
I can't believe you said that.
ELAINE
So, what did she say?
ELAINE
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
ELAINE
So where do you get this note?
ELAINE
What's the name of this physical therapist?
ELAINE
Why not?
ELAINE
No, I don't want the man either.
ELAINE
He'd just be touching your back.
ELAINE
No, it could get sexual.
ELAINE
I wouldn't be comfortable.
ELAINE
What could happen?
ELAINE
It's supposed to feel good.
ELAINE
Then why get the massage?
ELAINE
How'd it go? George?
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
ELAINE
Joe DiMaggio?
ELAINE
Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?
ELAINE
Why couldn't he be a dunker?
ELAINE
So then what?
ELAINE
Why didn't you just call out his name?
ELAINE
A what?
ELAINE
Hey, George? What is this? (Elaine makes the same outstretched arm
ELAINE
Three notes?
ELAINE
You got me a note?
ELAINE
But I got my own note.
ELAINE
I got a note from my gynecologist.
ELAINE
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
ELAINE
But you didn't say anything.
ELAINE
Well, I mean it's only six months probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
ELAINE
Of what? Oh.
ELAINE
What do they do?
ELAINE
He's dunking!
ELAINE
Hey, I didn't get one either.
ELAINE
This is what people do.
ELAINE
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
ELAINE
What do you do?
ELAINE
Who?
ELAINE
Isn't it going the other way?
ELAINE
What's the matter?
ELAINE
Oh she's fat?
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
I didn't pay attention.
ELAINE
I'm sure it's right around here.
ELAINE
It's black, right?
ELAINE
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
ELAINE
You'd better find this car.
ELAINE
There it is!...No that's not it.
ELAINE
Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
ELAINE
Those school zones are a killer.
ELAINE
(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
ELAINE
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
ELAINE
It felt like a couple of levels.
ELAINE
Look at that woman.
ELAINE
He's got it.
ELAINE
Jerry, look at my fish.
ELAINE
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
ELAINE
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
ELAINE
Five minutes.
ELAINE
We're not wilding.
ELAINE
Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
ELAINE
Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny - These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
ELAINE
Excuse me...
ELAINE
Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
ELAINE
Jerry!
ELAINE
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
ELAINE
No, no, I'll be back.
ELAINE
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
ELAINE
But why? Why can't you do it?
ELAINE
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
ELAINE
But why? Why don't you want to?
ELAINE
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
ELAINE
Jerry!
ELAINE
Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
ELAINE
Jerry! Over here...
ELAINE
Where have you been?
ELAINE
You what?
ELAINE
Look at my fish... 
ELAINE
Is he... 
ELAINE
Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
ELAINE
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
ELAINE
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
ELAINE
That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
ELAINE
I thought he was with you.
ELAINE
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? GEORGE We came in over there!
ELAINE
We didn't come in over there! JERRY Where's Kramer?
ELAINE
Hi, I'm Elaine.
ELAINE
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
ELAINE
What about my fish?
ELAINE
I'll say.
ELAINE
What is it?
ELAINE
The car!
ELAINE
We found it. I can't believe it!
ELAINE
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
ELAINE
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore
ELAINE
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
ELAINE
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
ELAINE
Of course I hear that.
ELAINE
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
ELAINE
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
No, I really don't.
ELAINE
I'm sure you could.
ELAINE
I don't know.
ELAINE
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a
ELAINE
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend
ELAINE
Why?
ELAINE
I'll pay for it.
ELAINE
Oh George, there's a space right there!
ELAINE
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
ELAINE
Will you just park it already?
ELAINE
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking
ELAINE
George?
ELAINE
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
ELAINE
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh.
ELAINE
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
ELAINE
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
ELAINE
What am I gonna say?
ELAINE
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
ELAINE
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the
ELAINE
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
ELAINE
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the
ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now
ELAINE
Exactly.
ELAINE
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy
ELAINE
Look out the window, you'll see.
ELAINE
Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
ELAINE
Hi.
ELAINE
You know that guy downstairs?
ELAINE
Are you going down?
ELAINE
Is anything wrong?
ELAINE
Be down in a minute.
ELAINE
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
ELAINE
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have
ELAINE
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and
ELAINE
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved
ELAINE
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
ELAINE
We just didn't think of you.
ELAINE
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
ELAINE
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through,
ELAINE
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
ELAINE
Right.
ELAINE
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
ELAINE
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
ELAINE
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
He thinks you're a phony?
ELAINE
Oh, you have to say something.
ELAINE
You gotta open the vault.
ELAINE
Open your vault.
ELAINE
You have no choice.
ELAINE
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
ELAINE
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
ELAINE
Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
ELAINE
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
ELAINE
I can't take your bedroom.
ELAINE
I can't kick you out of your bed.
ELAINE
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
ELAINE
Hi. Nice to meet you.
ELAINE
And scuba diving.
ELAINE
Mmm, nice to meet you.
ELAINE
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside down.
ELAINE
Come in.
ELAINE
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
ELAINE
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
ELAINE
I am never gonna fall asleep.
ELAINE
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
ELAINE
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
ELAINE
I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
ELAINE
Oh!
ELAINE
My back.
ELAINE
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
ELAINE
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
ELAINE
You can go.
ELAINE
(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
ELAINE
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
ELAINE
I've lost 6 pounds.
ELAINE
(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
ELAINE
The astronauts use them.
ELAINE
Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
ELAINE
No no, I wanna go.
ELAINE
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
ELAINE
You're not too cold?
ELAINE
Having a good time!
ELAINE
My back hurts.
ELAINE
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
ELAINE
Say what? (laughing) Say what?
ELAINE
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
ELAINE
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
ELAINE
(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
ELAINE
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
ELAINE
(discouraged) Five days. Here.
ELAINE
Excuse me?
ELAINE
(to Jerry) Five more days?
ELAINE
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be so nerve racking...
ELAINE
No, we would have heard it.
ELAINE
Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi...
ELAINE
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I
ELAINE
We did. We're just hanging out.
ELAINE
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
ELAINE
Have you thought about an intervention?
ELAINE
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get
ELAINE
I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
ELAINE
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!
ELAINE
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
ELAINE
(To Jerry) Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
ELAINE
He's good.
ELAINE
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from
ELAINE
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
ELAINE
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
ELAINE
All right.
ELAINE
Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.
ELAINE
Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you.
ELAINE
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
ELAINE
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
ELAINE
Yeah
ELAINE
What? How?
ELAINE
So? What happened?
ELAINE
Shut up!
ELAINE
Whar about Kramer?
ELAINE
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
ELAINE
What's the order?
ELAINE
Albano is your last name.
ELAINE
Hide!
ELAINE
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
ELAINE
You're getting warm.
ELAINE
Oh, hi Noel
ELAINE
(Chuckles)
ELAINE
(laughs)
ELAINE
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
ELAINE
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
ELAINE
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
ELAINE
Where did you find it?
ELAINE
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
ELAINE
I though I'd never find it.
ELAINE
No. Today's *your* lucky day.
ELAINE
You want to work here?
ELAINE
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
ELAINE
(softly to Dick) Dick.
ELAINE
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
ELAINE
And vodka.
ELAINE
Where's my drink?
ELAINE
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
ELAINE
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
ELAINE
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
ELAINE
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
ELAINE
No. I can't smell it.
ELAINE
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
ELAINE
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
ELAINE
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
ELAINE
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
ELAINE
Hey what's that?
ELAINE
Christmas present? For who?
ELAINE
*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
ELAINE
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
ELAINE
Oh, I love cashmere.
ELAINE
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
ELAINE
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
ELAINE
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
ELAINE
What?
ELAINE
Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
ELAINE
What don't you know?
ELAINE
Well do you see it or don't you?
ELAINE
Do you see it or don't you?
ELAINE
You're still here. You're a dynamo.
ELAINE
I'll see you tomorrow.
ELAINE
Dick was fired.
ELAINE
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
ELAINE
I'm not saying anything.
ELAINE
What could I be saying?
ELAINE
If I was saying something I would have said it.
ELAINE
I said it.
ELAINE
Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
ELAINE
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
ELAINE
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
ELAINE
How much did he save?
ELAINE
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
ELAINE
You did didn't you.
ELAINE
Well Jerry told me that you did.
ELAINE
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
ELAINE
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
ELAINE
Well that's not sex.
ELAINE
Kissing is not sex.
ELAINE
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
ELAINE
What are you doing here?
ELAINE
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
ELAINE
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
ELAINE
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
ELAINE
Ow, ow move over.
ELAINE
I've got no room.
ELAINE
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
ELAINE
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my
ELAINE
How old are you?
ELAINE
Whatever you want.
ELAINE
Yeah, me too.
ELAINE
Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing,
ELAINE
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
ELAINE
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
ELAINE
The dingo ate your baby!
ELAINE
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
ELAINE
Excuse me.
ELAINE
Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?
ELAINE
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
ELAINE
You don't know?
ELAINE
Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?
ELAINE
Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing.
ELAINE
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
ELAINE
Hey, is that real fur?
ELAINE
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so
ELAINE
Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
ELAINE
Fish don't feel any pain.
ELAINE
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
ELAINE
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.
ELAINE
Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a
ELAINE
Call Kramer.
ELAINE
You sure you don't need any help?
ELAINE
Call him again.
ELAINE
Six hundred and twenty million people died.
ELAINE
Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror.
ELAINE
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for
ELAINE
Thanks a lot.
ELAINE
Then how did you find the place?
ELAINE
But it's cold out.
ELAINE
I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti) Is that real fur?
ELAINE
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
ELAINE
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
ELAINE
All right, I'm gonna go.
ELAINE
9:30
ELAINE
Yeah, they flip a coin.
ELAINE
Yeah.
ELAINE
I can't. I'm the best man.
ELAINE
See'ya.
ELAINE
It's ironic.
ELAINE
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress,
ELAINE
Oh...
ELAINE
A wedding.
ELAINE
Yeah
ELAINE
You're telling me.
ELAINE
Oh, very nice.
ELAINE
She.
ELAINE
There is no he.
ELAINE
Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
ELAINE
Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
ELAINE
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men,
ELAINE
Too bad.
ELAINE
Get that out of my face.
ELAINE
George?
ELAINE
Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
ELAINE
Na.
ELAINE
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
ELAINE
I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
ELAINE
Hey, have you ever fasted?
ELAINE
What guy?
ELAINE
Oh, that creepy guy?
ELAINE
Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.
ELAINE
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
ELAINE
Uh uh, you should go some time.
ELAINE
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
ELAINE
Really?
ELAINE
Why would he come to George?
ELAINE
Take it away.
ELAINE
Should you be smoking?
ELAINE
You're pregnant.
ELAINE
It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
ELAINE
Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
ELAINE
It's disgusting.
ELAINE
Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
ELAINE
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
ELAINE
Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
ELAINE
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
ELAINE
