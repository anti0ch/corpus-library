GEORGE
Was the alarm on?
GEORGE
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
GEORGE
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
GEORGE
Maybe you should call your car phone.
GEORGE
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
GEORGE
Yeah, go ahead, call.
GEORGE
Who's Sid?
GEORGE
What do you mean?

What, do you pay him for that?

How many people does he do that for?
GEORGE
Could anybody do that?

You are?
GEORGE
How'd you get that?
GEORGE
Right out of the clear blue sky?
GEORGE
Well, why didn't they ask me?
GEORGE
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
GEORGE
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
GEORGE
I'm in a transition phase right now.
GEORGE
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm
GEORGE
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
GEORGE
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
GEORGE
Is that how you're gonna say it?
GEORGE
"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
GEORGE
That was no good?
GEORGE
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you
GEORGE
Oh man.

Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen)
GEORGE
What happened?
GEORGE
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen

GEORGE
Should I apologize to Woody?
GEORGE
Well I know how to drive.
GEORGE
I put my pants on, Sid.
GEORGE
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
GEORGE
Maybe I could call my father.

Do I smell?

No no no, I got it.

Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
GEORGE
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you
GEORGE
I don't know.
GEORGE
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.
GEORGE
Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
GEORGE
Little cologne.
GEORGE
Monica wants me to wear it.
GEORGE
I'm too nice.
GEORGE
She wants me to take an IQ test.
GEORGE
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.
GEORGE
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
GEORGE
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
GEORGE
I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.
GEORGE
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
GEORGE
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
GEORGE
What did I get or what do I say I got?
GEORGE
I say fourteen o nine (1409).
GEORGE
You're telling me.
GEORGE
You are my friend.
GEORGE
I tell you everything, right?
GEORGE
Well, this I take to the grave.
GEORGE
Hi.
GEORGE
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
GEORGE
What's that?
GEORGE
Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
GEORGE
I didn't take it yet.
GEORGE
What's casus belli.
GEORGE
Is it about me?
GEORGE
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
GEORGE
It varies.
GEORGE
145!
GEORGE
You should take the test for me.
GEORGE
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?
GEORGE
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
GEORGE
Why not?
GEORGE
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.
GEORGE
You'll do it?
GEORGE
Yeaah, beautiful...(They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
GEORGE
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
GEORGE
I can't concentrate in front of you.
GEORGE
Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.
GEORGE
Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.
GEORGE
Don't need it.
GEORGE
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.
GEORGE
Eh, twenty to three.
GEORGE
Thanks again.
GEORGE
And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.
GEORGE
Yeah?
GEORGE
Oh, it's locked?
GEORGE
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.
GEORGE
Wish I could.
GEORGE
What did you go on a picnic?
GEORGE
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
GEORGE
Ok. (George opens the door.) Here you go.
GEORGE
Piece of cake.
GEORGE
What? I spilled some food on it.
GEORGE
What are you talking about?
GEORGE
From my pocket.
GEORGE
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
GEORGE
Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
GEORGE
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, from the grocery store.
GEORGE
I walked.
GEORGE
I climbed out the window.
GEORGE
Of course.
GEORGE
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.
GEORGE
Coming up.
GEORGE
85!
GEORGE
85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
GEORGE
Oh, hello professor.
GEORGE
Please...
GEORGE
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
GEORGE
Whow, forget it.
GEORGE
You could do worst!
GEORGE
All right, I'll ask her.
GEORGE
How' you doing?
GEORGE
You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...
GEORGE
Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.
GEORGE
That's a good score.
GEORGE
Italian.
GEORGE
Prognosis Negative!
GEORGE
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha
GEORGE
Can't go, Why not?
GEORGE
I thought Kramer was watching.
GEORGE
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
GEORGE
You spritz a little Lysol on it.
GEORGE
So we're not going?
GEORGE
Oh. You still wanna go?
GEORGE
If you want.
GEORGE
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
GEORGE
What about this--
GEORGE
It's just we want you to go.
GEORGE
So how long did you live there?
GEORGE
That's pretty long.
GEORGE
It's not that long, really.
GEORGE
And then you came here.
GEORGE
Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,
GEORGE
I like herbal tea.
GEORGE
Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
GEORGE
Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
GEORGE
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
GEORGE
You don't tell him?
GEORGE
You don't tell him?
GEORGE
That is so funny!
GEORGE
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
GEORGE
Prognosis Negative!
GEORGE
Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
GEORGE
What does this mean?
GEORGE
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
GEORGE
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
GEORGE
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
GEORGE
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
GEORGE
Hey, go.
GEORGE
What, are you doing me a favor?
GEORGE
How's it going?
GEORGE
Things are good.
GEORGE
I know.
GEORGE
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
GEORGE
How come we never hear him?
GEORGE
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
GEORGE
Oh.
GEORGE
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm
GEORGE
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,
GEORGE
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
GEORGE
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
GEORGE
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but
GEORGE
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
GEORGE
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
GEORGE
Of course it is.
GEORGE
Exactly.
GEORGE
Right.
GEORGE
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
GEORGE
Good.
GEORGE
Ridiculous!
GEORGE
Oh, you're dead.
GEORGE
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet
GEORGE
No, I won't.
GEORGE
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
GEORGE
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and
GEORGE
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on
GEORGE
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become
GEORGE
It's my only hope.
GEORGE
Out of the question. Out of the question!
GEORGE
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads!
GEORGE
How good looking?
GEORGE
Really good looking?
GEORGE
Would you take her out?
GEORGE
Oh, you hesitated.
GEORGE
No, something's off here, you hesitated.
GEORGE
What about the body, what kind of body?
GEORGE
How nice?
GEORGE
Just nice?
GEORGE
Really good?
GEORGE
What about personality?
GEORGE
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
GEORGE
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what
GEORGE
What kind of hair?
GEORGE
Flowing?
GEORGE
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is
GEORGE
Yeah, that's right.
GEORGE
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to
GEORGE
I'd like to be able to get it out.
GEORGE
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
GEORGE
Is there a pinkish hue?
GEORGE
Yes, a rosy glow.
GEORGE
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too
GEORGE
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty
GEORGE
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials,
GEORGE
It's mellifluous!
GEORGE
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great
GEORGE
Hey! Saturday night!
GEORGE
So, what did she say?
GEORGE
That's it?
GEORGE
She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
GEORGE
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great
GEORGE
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
GEORGE
What are you gonna do with all of them?
GEORGE
I'll take one. It's possible.
GEORGE
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
GEORGE
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we
GEORGE
It's in the vault?
GEORGE
We had sex.
GEORGE
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine.
GEORGE
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with
GEORGE
What are you gonna do?
GEORGE
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was
GEORGE
No, don't call her.
GEORGE
No, Jerry, don't call.
GEORGE
I don't want you to call.
GEORGE
Give me the phone!
GEORGE
Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
GEORGE
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
GEORGE
But tell him to give me the--
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Defective?!
GEORGE
How could you give me a defective condom?!
GEORGE
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
GEORGE
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father!
GEORGE
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
GEORGE
Stop it, stop it.
GEORGE
This is good. Oh, this is good.
GEORGE
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
GEORGE
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is
GEORGE
So you didn't turn her in?
GEORGE
Gonna see her again?
GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
GEORGE
Yes! I see enormous potential here.
GEORGE
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.
GEORGE
I don't think so.
GEORGE
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
GEORGE
Tell her about the shoving.
GEORGE
No! Tell her.
GEORGE
You'll pay? I'm there.
GEORGE
Pass the salt please.
GEORGE
Bread.
GEORGE
God bless you.
GEORGE
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't
GEORGE
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
GEORGE
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not
GEORGE
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
GEORGE
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes
GEORGE
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed
GEORGE
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I
GEORGE
Ah, shut up.
GEORGE
Who?
GEORGE
Why?!
GEORGE
Where's the remote phone?
GEORGE
God.
GEORGE
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get
GEORGE
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
GEORGE
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and
GEORGE
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
GEORGE
Well, who is she?
GEORGE
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't
GEORGE
You can't compromise your principles!
GEORGE
Can't live!
GEORGE
This country needs more people like you!
GEORGE
I believe strongly in that as you know.
GEORGE
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
GEORGE
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
GEORGE
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
GEORGE
Oh yeah.
GEORGE
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of
GEORGE
Well, that's a given.
GEORGE
Must be hell living in that house.
GEORGE
Hey.
GEORGE
No, why, what's happening?
GEORGE
Yeah, okay.
GEORGE
What?!
GEORGE
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
GEORGE
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
GEORGE
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
GEORGE
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her
GEORGE
Oh don't-
GEORGE
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
GEORGE
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
GEORGE
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the
GEORGE
Come on let's get out of here.
GEORGE
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
GEORGE
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
GEORGE
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
GEORGE
I suppose I could.
GEORGE
Me?
GEORGE
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
GEORGE
Yearn? Do I yearn?
GEORGE
You yearn.
GEORGE
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
GEORGE
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
GEORGE
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
Uh...no.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
I like to get the Daily News!
GEORGE
Why?
GEORGE
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
GEORGE
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
GEORGE
Uh, no, I'm not.
GEORGE
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
GEORGE
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
GEORGE
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
GEORGE
That's Kramer.
GEORGE
What for?
GEORGE
Jerry? Why?
GEORGE
So what?
GEORGE
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
GEORGE
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
GEORGE
You never should have taken away his keys!
GEORGE
How'd the Mets do?
GEORGE
Yeah, coy.
GEORGE
Sure. (Turns around.)
GEORGE
No we're not.
GEORGE
Ask her about Kramer.
GEORGE
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
GEORGE
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
GEORGE
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
GEORGE
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
GEORGE
Nope, no can do.
GEORGE
Do you wanna fight?
GEORGE
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
GEORGE
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.
GEORGE
Nothing.
GEORGE
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
GEORGE
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
GEORGE
Well, what do they look like?
GEORGE
Well, they're obviously not here.
GEORGE
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
GEORGE
Gimme half!
GEORGE
Why didn't she tell us?
GEORGE
We hardly read anything!
GEORGE
He forced me to!
GEORGE
Yes you did!
GEORGE
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
GEORGE
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
GEORGE
Whose are these?
GEORGE
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly!
GEORGE
(incredulous) What?
GEORGE
Nothing.
GEORGE
I don't get art.
GEORGE
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have
GEORGE
What for?
GEORGE
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
GEORGE
You know, I'm a little nervous.
GEORGE
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm
GEORGE
Really? I thought you liked her.
GEORGE
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not
GEORGE
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
GEORGE
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
GEORGE
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
GEORGE
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
GEORGE
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
GEORGE
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not
GEORGE
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
GEORGE
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up
GEORGE
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right
GEORGE
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
GEORGE
I'd rather go to a hanging.
GEORGE
Yeah?
GEORGE
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
GEORGE
--and this is Kramer.
GEORGE
Okay.
GEORGE
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs.
GEORGE
Just take the cap off.
GEORGE
Just take the cap off!
GEORGE
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
GEORGE
Okay, we'll go!
GEORGE
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
GEORGE
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
GEORGE
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
GEORGE
You weren't thinking.
GEORGE
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!
GEORGE
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a
GEORGE
Hey, Kramer.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
What's it say?
GEORGE
WOW!
GEORGE
(on intercom) It's George.
GEORGE
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
GEORGE
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact,
GEORGE
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should
GEORGE
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
GEORGE
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
GEORGE
How 'bout Kramer.
GEORGE
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally
GEORGE
This is incredible!
GEORGE
Maybe I won't send her that check.
GEORGE
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
GEORGE
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
GEORGE
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right
GEORGE
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
GEORGE
Jerry,
GEORGE
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
GEORGE
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some
GEORGE
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
GEORGE
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
GEORGE
(yells) I didn't tattle
GEORGE
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
GEORGE
Some other time.
GEORGE
Let's see if it's Hayman?
GEORGE
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because
GEORGE
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say,
GEORGE
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
GEORGE
Little baked beans
GEORGE
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym.
GEORGE
... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
GEORGE
Yes, Mr. Hayman
GEORGE
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
GEORGE
I'm not really sure, I...
GEORGE
He gave me a wedgie.
GEORGE
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
GEORGE
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
GEORGE
It's George
GEORGE
Well, it's definetly him.
GEORGE
Him who? Hayman him.
GEORGE
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down
GEORGE
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move.
GEORGE
It was.
GEORGE
How should I know?
GEORGE
Me?
GEORGE
The locker room!
GEORGE
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
GEORGE
Yes Mr. Hayman.
GEORGE
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
GEORGE
I'm not really sure, I...
GEORGE
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
GEORGE
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman
GEORGE
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
GEORGE
Where?
GEORGE
But you have a watch on.
GEORGE
Why don't you just look at your watch?
GEORGE
Let me see the watch.
GEORGE
You know we're living in a society!
GEORGE
Jerry. Jerry.
GEORGE
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
GEORGE
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
How do you know?
GEORGE
We should take his limo.
GEORGE
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you
GEORGE
Well the guy's just standing there.
GEORGE
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
GEORGE
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a
GEORGE
What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
GEORGE
I'll be O'Brien.
GEORGE
You're you.
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
What, you don't want to be you?
GEORGE
Like who?
GEORGE
Well I like Dylan.
GEORGE
Colin O'Brien.
GEORGE
I'm Colin O'Brien.
GEORGE
Are we really doing this?
GEORGE
Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
GEORGE
Sorry we're late.
GEORGE
Oh thank you.
GEORGE
Thank you very much. Dylan?
GEORGE
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done
GEORGE
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am.
GEORGE
Can he hear us?
GEORGE
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
GEORGE
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up
GEORGE
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you
GEORGE
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to
GEORGE
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
GEORGE
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
GEORGE
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait,
GEORGE
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
GEORGE
He knows?
GEORGE
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
GEORGE
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
GEORGE
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other
GEORGE
It was a good jig.
GEORGE
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
GEORGE
Well you should have been O'Brien.
GEORGE
Yes, you have to be Murphy.
GEORGE
You're Murphy!
GEORGE
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
GEORGE
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
GEORGE
We're slowing down. Are those the people?
GEORGE
Hello. I'm O'Brien.
GEORGE
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
GEORGE
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman
GEORGE
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
GEORGE
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
GEORGE
Okay, I mean it's serious but--
GEORGE
Uh, my speech?
GEORGE
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied
GEORGE
I said so many things.
GEORGE
They're shooting! They're shooting!
GEORGE
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
GEORGE
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
GEORGE
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
GEORGE
I don't know.
GEORGE
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
GEORGE
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real
GEORGE
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
GEORGE
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah
GEORGE
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The
GEORGE
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle
GEORGE
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
GEORGE
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular
GEORGE
Good. I think you forgot something.
GEORGE
Good. Now get out.
GEORGE
Okay, what are we gonna do?
GEORGE
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see
GEORGE
Me??
GEORGE
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
GEORGE
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to
GEORGE
What do I do?! What do I do?!
GEORGE
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone!
GEORGE
Where'd you meet her?
GEORGE
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
GEORGE
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb.
GEORGE
Wow. What'd you say?
GEORGE
Wow.
GEORGE
What did she say?
GEORGE
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all
GEORGE
I had a job interview.
GEORGE
Take a guess.
GEORGE
Ok, thanks.
GEORGE
Yeah, right.
GEORGE
Oh, nothing.
GEORGE
You won't think I'm a bad person?
GEORGE
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a
GEORGE
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
GEORGE
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little
GEORGE
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be
GEORGE
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a
GEORGE
How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
GEORGE
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
GEORGE
What, you didn't wash all day?
GEORGE
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
GEORGE
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause)
GEORGE
They way he just says stuff.
GEORGE
Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
GEORGE
About the pizza?
GEORGE
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
GEORGE
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but
GEORGE
Peter Jennings had one.
GEORGE
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class
GEORGE
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
GEORGE
It's a cleaning.
GEORGE
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you
GEORGE
What the hell.
GEORGE
Me? I didn't say anything.
GEORGE
I didn't encourage. No encourage.
GEORGE
It's possible.
GEORGE
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
GEORGE
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
GEORGE
Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the
GEORGE
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
GEORGE
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
GEORGE
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
GEORGE
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
GEORGE
Good for you.
GEORGE
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not
GEORGE
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that
GEORGE
Yeah?
GEORGE
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
GEORGE
Too much salt in my diet.
GEORGE
Nah, I'm good.
GEORGE
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
GEORGE
It's like, all dented.
GEORGE
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern
GEORGE
Shut up?
GEORGE
Interesting.
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
Oh, I got it.
GEORGE
Yeah, phew.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
We did?
GEORGE
Hawaii?
GEORGE
Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
GEORGE
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane
GEORGE
Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
GEORGE
Elaine. Shut up.
GEORGE
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel
GEORGE
Why don't you ever go shopping?
GEORGE
Not even an apple.
GEORGE
What about this leftover Chinese food?
GEORGE
This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't
GEORGE
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
GEORGE
You don't have to pay for the massage?
GEORGE
Right, your friend Roy.
GEORGE
And you don't have to pay.
GEORGE
We have three-o'clock appointments.
GEORGE
Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
GEORGE
But, uh, Raymond is a man.
GEORGE
I can't get a massage from a man.
GEORGE
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
GEORGE
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching
GEORGE
He'd just be touching your back too.
GEORGE
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get
GEORGE
I would? What if something happens?
GEORGE
What if it felt good?
GEORGE
I don't want it to feel good.
GEORGE
Exactly!
GEORGE
Yes?
GEORGE
Hello.
GEORGE
Really.
GEORGE
Oh boy.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
I don't know.
GEORGE
Nah.
GEORGE
Coffee. Too much coffee.
GEORGE
Oh, the hamstring's fine.
GEORGE
I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
GEORGE
Are you sure?
GEORGE
I don't know.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
Korea.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Korea.
GEORGE
Hamstring.
GEORGE
Hotel.
GEORGE
A...
GEORGE
A man gave me...
GEORGE
A man gave me... a massage.
GEORGE
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...
GEORGE
He was... touching and rubbing.
GEORGE
And then I took my pants off.
GEORGE
For my hamstring.
GEORGE
He got about two inches from... there.
GEORGE
I think it moved.
GEORGE
It may have moved, I don't know.
GEORGE
It moved! It was imperceptible but I felt it.
GEORGE
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
GEORGE
That's the sign! The test; if a man makes it move.
GEORGE
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
GEORGE
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees
GEORGE
I don't even like to use urinals, I've always been a stall man.
GEORGE
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about
GEORGE
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not
GEORGE
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
GEORGE
He didn't say he can't.
GEORGE
He doesn't feel funny.
GEORGE
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
GEORGE
He knows that!
GEORGE
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
GEORGE
How would I know?
GEORGE
What do you mean, like him?
GEORGE
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
GEORGE
Why should I?
GEORGE
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
GEORGE
One of those kids called me a Mary.
GEORGE
I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this.
GEORGE
Told me what?
GEORGE
He didn't say anything.
GEORGE
Hello.
GEORGE
How ya doing?
GEORGE
Me neither.
GEORGE
Me too.
GEORGE
Tragic.
GEORGE
No?
GEORGE
Unsettling?
GEORGE
Me neither. I've never been happy.
GEORGE
In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
GEORGE
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
GEORGE
How ya doing?
GEORGE
Hello.
GEORGE
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll
GEORGE
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! 
GEORGE
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get
GEORGE
Joe DiMaggio.
GEORGE
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at
GEORGE
One left...what a joke.
GEORGE
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
GEORGE
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
GEORGE
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
GEORGE
What time is it?
GEORGE
Always late. Always late.
GEORGE
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
GEORGE
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
GEORGE
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
GEORGE
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"
GEORGE
You don't know where we parked?
GEORGE
Oh, this is great.
GEORGE
This is just what I need.
GEORGE
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
GEORGE
You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
GEORGE
It's this way...
GEORGE
...Six wrong?
GEORGE
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
GEORGE
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
GEORGE
Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Hey, is that necessary?
GEORGE
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
GEORGE
...What?
GEORGE
You are!
GEORGE
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
GEORGE
Oh are they gonna be furious.
GEORGE
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
GEORGE
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
GEORGE
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
GEORGE
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
GEORGE
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
GEORGE
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
GEORGE
Really.
GEORGE
Who's Killer Kowalski?
GEORGE
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
GEORGE
Here?
GEORGE
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
GEORGE
A Red Chinese prison?
GEORGE
Me too.
GEORGE
Elaine, shut-up.
GEORGE
I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
GEORGE
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
GEORGE
Look at the time, that's it.
GEORGE
So what do you want me to do?
GEORGE
That is an opening.
GEORGE
Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
GEORGE
You will?
GEORGE
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
GEORGE
Yeah, right.
GEORGE
It's a blue Honda...
GEORGE
Hi Amy, I'm George.
GEORGE
I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
GEORGE
...with that group.
GEORGE
The car!
GEORGE
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
GEORGE
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
GEORGE
Seven forty-five.
GEORGE
Right.
GEORGE
Eight o'clock.
GEORGE
I really think it looks good.
GEORGE
All bald people look good in hats.
GEORGE
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
GEORGE
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that
GEORGE
Do you hear that?
GEORGE
You had to move the mirror?
GEORGE
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my
GEORGE
I can't drive?
GEORGE
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have
GEORGE
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
GEORGE
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
GEORGE
Alright, start looking for spaces.
GEORGE
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front
GEORGE
I can't park in a garage.
GEORGE
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking,
GEORGE
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's
GEORGE
Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream
GEORGE
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into
GEORGE
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's
GEORGE
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
GEORGE
Hey, what are you doing?
GEORGE
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
GEORGE
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head
GEORGE
I was in the middle of a conversation.
GEORGE
The point is I was here first.
GEORGE
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
GEORGE
Are you gonna move the car?
GEORGE
Jerk!
GEORGE
Do you believe this guy?
GEORGE
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
GEORGE
Are you coming back down?
GEORGE
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what
GEORGE
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
GEORGE
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
GEORGE
Hey!
GEORGE
Yeah, I'm fine.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
How do you know him?
GEORGE
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
GEORGE
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
GEORGE
Oh great.
GEORGE
It's my space!
GEORGE
I'll die out here.
GEORGE
Oh, come on.
GEORGE
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my
GEORGE
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you
GEORGE
You've got a prayer.
GEORGE
Did you talk to him?
GEORGE
You told him? What did you tell him?
GEORGE
I don't believe it, what did you say?
GEORGE
A pack of teenagers?
GEORGE
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
GEORGE
Oh great.
GEORGE
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
GEORGE
Hey, who's talking to you?
GEORGE
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know
GEORGE
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
GEORGE
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
GEORGE
Yeah, I'm sorry.
GEORGE
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that
GEORGE
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
Uh huh.
GEORGE
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what
GEORGE
I learned a lot about myself.
GEORGE
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
GEORGE
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
GEORGE
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
GEORGE
No no no, that's in the right position.
GEORGE
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
GEORGE
Do you?
GEORGE
Sid, it's completely his fault.
GEORGE
Don't do it!
GEORGE
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
GEORGE
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that
GEORGE
So you're against me now?
GEORGE
He's right. never.
GEORGE
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
GEORGE
Oh please.
GEORGE
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
GEORGE
Well, thank you for your support.
GEORGE
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
GEORGE
Yeah, thanks.
GEORGE
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
GEORGE
No! Get out of here, Newman.
GEORGE
No, Newman, stop it.
GEORGE
I don't want him to!
GEORGE
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There!
GEORGE
Alright, just keep the hat!
GEORGE
I'm not going if he's going.
GEORGE
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
GEORGE
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
GEORGE
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
GEORGE
I don't have a job!
GEORGE
...pianist. A classical pianist. She plays the piano. She's a
GEORGE
We did a crossword puzzle together, in bed. It was the most fun
GEORGE
I was telling you about Noel.
GEORGE
(sarcastically) Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
GEORGE
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
GEORGE
No everything is not going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have
GEORGE
How do I get the hand?
GEORGE
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
GEORGE
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll
GEORGE
With all due respect, I don't think so...
GEORGE
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
GEORGE
What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
GEORGE
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
GEORGE
No, I-I-I know... (retreats back to his Chinese take out) I know...
GEORGE
No...
GEORGE
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
GEORGE
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud
GEORGE
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first
GEORGE
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
GEORGE
What are we gonna tell her?
GEORGE
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then
GEORGE
Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
GEORGE
What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell her.
GEORGE
Uh, can we cut to the chase?
GEORGE
Yeah...
GEORGE
A lot of people say it.
GEORGE
(Accusingly) What's that?
GEORGE
(Realizing full well it isn't) ...Yes it is.
GEORGE
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
GEORGE
All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
GEORGE
Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
GEORGE
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
GEORGE
Me, uh, uh, no, ...
GEORGE
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
GEORGE
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
GEORGE
We'll have a good time
GEORGE
Ah, come on
GEORGE
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. (exits)
GEORGE
It's George
GEORGE
Well it's over. It's definitely over.
GEORGE
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation.
GEORGE
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
GEORGE
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said
GEORGE
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.
GEORGE
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose.
GEORGE
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
GEORGE

GEORGE
Shocked?
GEORGE
Never expected this did you?
GEORGE
Well, live and learn.
GEORGE
Kind of.
GEORGE
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
GEORGE
Now, stop it ...
GEORGE
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
GEORGE
This is what I'm talking about.
GEORGE
All the time.
GEORGE
I can't hear you.
GEORGE
See, It's not so hard.
GEORGE
It's George
GEORGE
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
GEORGE
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
GEORGE
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man."
GEORGE
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
GEORGE
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
GEORGE
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
GEORGE
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
GEORGE
I can't do these puzzles.
GEORGE
Ah ah Pez dispenser.
GEORGE
Well they're hard to load.
GEORGE
Poor kid.
GEORGE
What did you do?
GEORGE
Wow
GEORGE
What's a three letter word for candy?
GEORGE
Like you do.
GEORGE
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
GEORGE
Why did France give that to us anyway?
GEORGE
So countries just exchange gifts like that?
GEORGE
There's Elaine.
GEORGE
Really? They work here in the office?
GEORGE
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
GEORGE
Really?
GEORGE
"Off the wagon"?
GEORGE
I think it's "on the wagon".
GEORGE
Well today's your lucky day.
GEORGE
It will be my first one.
GEORGE
Huh?
GEORGE
How can you just get it?
GEORGE
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
GEORGE
I like Mike Lubika.
GEORGE
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
GEORGE
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
GEORGE
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
GEORGE
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
GEORGE
Venetian Blinds.
GEORGE
I think he was impressed.
GEORGE
Told you.
GEORGE
Do I really have to buy her something?
GEORGE
What is that? Is that cashmere?
GEORGE
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
GEORGE
Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
GEORGE
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
GEORGE
What? I don't see anything.
GEORGE
Oh yeah.
GEORGE
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
GEORGE
You think she would care about the red dot?
GEORGE
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
GEORGE
Yeah, but you know where it is.
GEORGE
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
GEORGE
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
GEORGE
Please.
GEORGE
(over the speaker) It's George.
GEORGE
Hello everybody.
GEORGE
(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
GEORGE
It's an early Christmas present.
GEORGE
For you.
GEORGE
Of course it's cashmere.
GEORGE
Well who doesn't.
GEORGE
Ahh, money.
GEORGE
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
GEORGE
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
GEORGE
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
GEORGE
I can't believe I get paid for this.
GEORGE
How you doing?
GEORGE
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
GEORGE
Why is that?
GEORGE
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
GEORGE
Convulsing?
GEORGE
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
GEORGE
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
GEORGE
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
GEORGE
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
GEORGE
(over the speaker) It's George.
GEORGE
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
GEORGE
Did you tell her anything?
GEORGE
Do you swear?
GEORGE
Oh you told her didn't you.
GEORGE
What? Did I what?
GEORGE
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
GEORGE
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
GEORGE
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
GEORGE
This is for you.
GEORGE
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
GEORGE
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
GEORGE
Of course it's cashemere.
GEORGE
Just a little something for Christmas.
GEORGE
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
GEORGE
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
GEORGE
Who said that?
GEORGE
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
GEORGE
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
GEORGE
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
GEORGE
You never had sex in the office before?
GEORGE
Alright so you made out with someone.
GEORGE
Kissing is sex.
GEORGE
Jerry.
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
Over here.
GEORGE
Hide, hide under the desk.
GEORGE
Of course it's cashmere.
GEORGE
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they
GEORGE
That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?
GEORGE
You know Ava's gonna be there.
GEORGE
The nice one that works in my office.
GEORGE
I'll drive.
GEORGE
It's supposed to be a good party.
GEORGE
No, there'll be girls there.
GEORGE
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between
GEORGE
You got isobutane-30?
GEORGE
A-ha.
GEORGE
Got it.
GEORGE
You got aloe?  I love aloe.
GEORGE
Jersey.
GEORGE
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
GEORGE
Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you
GEORGE
I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
GEORGE
You owe me ten dollars.
GEORGE
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this
GEORGE
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
GEORGE
No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's
GEORGE
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
GEORGE
You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do
GEORGE
Eva.
GEORGE
Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?
GEORGE
I don't believe it.
GEORGE
Mark, is this true?
GEORGE
How's it going?
GEORGE
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off
GEORGE
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
GEORGE
No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes
GEORGE
Now?
GEORGE
Gimme a half-hour.
GEORGE
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
GEORGE
I think something's happening here.
GEORGE
I think she wants me to take her home.
GEORGE
What should I do?
GEORGE
What about you and Elaine?
GEORGE
Are you sure?
GEORGE
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
I swear.
GEORGE
I, I, I can't.
GEORGE
Please, it's--
GEORGE
I... I... I long for you.
GEORGE
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
GEORGE
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating.
GEORGE
That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus?
GEORGE
I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for
GEORGE
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
GEORGE
Yeah, good night.
GEORGE
Could we talk about this some other time?
GEORGE
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
GEORGE
Goldfish.
GEORGE
That's why we're here in America.
GEORGE
Yeah, me either.
GEORGE
What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
GEORGE
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day
GEORGE
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a
GEORGE
I have no choice, I'm quitting.
GEORGE
How much is that?
GEORGE
Nine sixty?  Give it to me.
GEORGE
Don't worry, I got it.
GEORGE
I got it.
GEORGE
I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.
GEORGE
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
GEORGE
Just walk.
GEORGE
What?
GEORGE
Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
GEORGE
Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.
GEORGE
What are you talking about?
GEORGE
What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?
GEORGE
You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.
GEORGE
Oh, great guy.
GEORGE
The one with the long sideburns?
GEORGE
Where does he come off?
GEORGE
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
GEORGE
9:45
GEORGE
Why not?
GEORGE
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The
GEORGE
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they
GEORGE
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
GEORGE
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're
GEORGE
Yeah.
GEORGE
How many tickets are you paying today?
GEORGE
No doors?
GEORGE
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
GEORGE
That guy is not blind.
GEORGE
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
GEORGE
That's amazing.
GEORGE
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second
GEORGE
Me, why?
GEORGE
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is.
GEORGE
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
GEORGE
Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
GEORGE
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board.
GEORGE
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion.
GEORGE
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long
GEORGE
Oh, you do?
GEORGE
No, no, what, what?
GEORGE
Yeah, well....
GEORGE
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when
GEORGE
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train!
GEORGE
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
GEORGE
Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
GEORGE
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
GEORGE
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in
GEORGE
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts
GEORGE
What's going on?
GEORGE
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
GEORGE
What are you doing? You're robbing me?
GEORGE
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
GEORGE
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg .
GEORGE
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
GEORGE
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little
GEORGE
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
GEORGE
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
GEORGE
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
GEORGE
It's George.
GEORGE
Yeah, right.
GEORGE
Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.
GEORGE
There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
GEORGE
You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
GEORGE
It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.
GEORGE
No, no the full size.
GEORGE
You didn't say "junior".
GEORGE
He didn't seem too pleased.
GEORGE
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
GEORGE
I haven't seen him for months.
GEORGE
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
GEORGE
I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
GEORGE
Really?
GEORGE
I'd love to go. Make an appointment.
GEORGE
I just got fired.
GEORGE
It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
GEORGE
I knew it. I always felt different.
GEORGE
Drakes?
GEORGE
Did you buy this for me?
GEORGE
Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.
GEORGE
She hasn't eaten in two days.
GEORGE
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
GEORGE
When I hear her name mentioned.
GEORGE
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
GEORGE
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
GEORGE
Elaine.
GEORGE
Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
GEORGE
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
GEORGE
Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.
GEORGE
Should I not go on this trip?
GEORGE
Elaine, what are you doing?
GEORGE
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
GEORGE
If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.
GEORGE
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
GEORGE
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me.
GEORGE
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest.
GEORGE
How come?
GEORGE
Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
GEORGE
No.
GEORGE
The psychic said something terrible will happen.
GEORGE
...sweetheart, no come here, ... sweetheart
GEORGE
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
GEORGE
Oh, that's great. That's great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don't even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn't get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
GEORGE
I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? ... Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
GEORGE
Yeah, why? Why?
GEORGE
Because? Because?
GEORGE
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

GEORGE
I told her that she was pretentious.

GEORGE
No, no she wasn't.
GEORGE
No, I didn't.
GEORGE
A mental institution.
GEORGE
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression
GEORGE
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
GEORGE
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
GEORGE
I don't know.
GEORGE
Where?
GEORGE
We could.
GEORGE
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.

I should be in a place like this I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear

Blanket
GEORGE
Grass
GEORGE
Oh, boy. Here she comes.

GEORGE
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
GEORGE
What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
GEORGE
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
GEORGE
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
GEORGE
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks,
GEORGE
Hey, I'm getting in on that.
GEORGE
You're going that way anyway!
