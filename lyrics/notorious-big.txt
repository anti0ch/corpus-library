Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying? It's all good baby baby It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's aaalll good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all (It's all good) Aand if you don't know, now you know, nigga Uh, uh, check it out (yeah)
Junior M.A.F.I.A. (hehe, mm)
Uh (I like this) Yeah, yeah. Nine-fo' (keep bangin) To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches, in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet, is where you'll find me (what?)
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (huh)
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin'
But I just can't quit
'Cause one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin'' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree "I love it when you call me big poppa"
Throw your hands in the air, if you'se a true player
"I love it when you call me big pop-pa"
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
"I love it when you call me big poppa"
If you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby Straight up honey really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin' but they be actin
Who they attractin' with that line, "What's your name what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)
Forget the telly we just go to the crib
and watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke L's while you do me "I love it when you call me big pop-pa"
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
"I love it when you call me big pop-pa"
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
"I love it when you call me big pop-pa"
If you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby (How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?)
In mansion and Benz's givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams (what?)
Choppin O's, smokin' lye an' Optimo's
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Gucci sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man girlfriend Honey check it, tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, shit we can do this every weekend
Aight? Is that aight with you? Yeah, keep bangin' "I love it when you call me big poppa"
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
"I love it when you call me big poppa"
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies

If you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby Uh, check it out, nine-fo' shit for dat ass

Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, haha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin ain't sayin' nuttin' (nope) so I just

On the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass
Gon' blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras, menage-a-tois, sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plantiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shhh)

You know the Ep along by James Todd
Smith I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter skinny or fat or Light skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Aiy papi"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck Tae Kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newton
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him Old thing back
Like B I double G I E, with some R U L E
Notorious know to bust in your E Y E, baby baby
Bitches know they love and hate me I come, you come, we come with back some maybe
How close we came to coming together is crazy
How come you ain't your sis with similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches You know there's a bigger picture than the camera rolled
'Cause I only got to knowin' how the shits unfolded
Back shots through the rear, got the mack unloaded
Got a reload, like every so-often Sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back What you wanna do?
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL
The E&J; and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamin's
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in I fuck nonstop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though I got the cleanest, meanest, penis
Ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the Spandex and hit my man next Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die? Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die? It's on me
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed "thug life" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die? Good evenin' ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G.
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him y'all Uh, a nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray (Uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
That hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid 'em, stole wid 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear, Oshkosh with blue and white ducks
Pass the blunt Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want Uh-huh, I was a shame, my crew was lame
I have enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go 'round
Plus I'm fuckin, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to English, pass off a global
The only nigga wit a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Ya brain was a terrible thing to waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggas, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker, see you chumps on top Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubble-goose
Now I got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we want to know is "where the party at?"
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Betta throw my vest on my chest
Cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggas like I was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we want to do is [Chorus]
Party, and bullshit, and [Repeat: x9] Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man see that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love I'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping big poppa, I'm a bad boy
Niggas want to front, who got your back? (biggie!)
Niggas want to flex, who got the gat? (biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the henny and stuff
Or some brand-Nubian shit beatin' down punks! [Chorus] Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "let's leave calm"
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like lil' shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that. Party, and bullshit, (party.)
And party, and bullshit, (bullshit.)
And party, and bullshit, (party.)
And party, and bullshit, (bullshit.)
And party, and bullshit, (yea, junior mafia likes that.)

On your days alone I can make you moan
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce
Bad Boy get more money than you can count
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce
I'd do it to you cats for a large amount
And when the beef come, you no where to be found
While I'll be around 'til the winner is announced (The winner is)

No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them, (naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is building up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' Ayo Big, ayo Big When the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed, sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'mna spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali) If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon' stop, giving LA props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin' Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali) Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light
I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches belly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite
Cali, great place to visit I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (Going back to Cali)

Listen Uh yeah baby ooh, listen to me, oh yeah When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the 'Thriller in Manila'
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drug flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you did, where you are
You're with a star Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back

With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love to hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to comin' together is crazy
How come you and your sister make similar faces
When y'all cummin' y'all be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows there's a bigger picture than the camera rollin'
'Cause I don't think y'all be knowin' how the shit's unfoldin'
Back shots to the rear, got the MAC unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back (Shit) What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you did, where you are
You're with a star Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E&J; and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
Fulfillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission
Fuck the kissin', lickin' down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin', all of a sudden What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?

High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew

Goodfellas down to the Mo Thugs dudes

How many flees when I 'cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo Thugs
Trained to be perfect, disciples
When it's survival tongue, never double-edged sword
Triple, six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breakin' out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddeon shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Claire
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender never no surrender no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend friend, hey
Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marchin we shootin'
In daily recruitin' there's a tough law
Everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little we give 'em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get 'em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off
Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin' they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin' we buckin' them guzzlers, fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be serving 'em dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talking
Like "gimme back me money"
Thugging with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?

Biggie, blue's on my ass, pull out the cellular phone to call Bone
"What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packing

Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit

Uhh, uhh, what?

To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that booty is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we lovin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger lovin in the park
{Piss}y off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo feet
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I {hit} that
Way she used to giggle when yo booty would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends [Chorus x2] [Verse 2 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo freakin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Chick keep yo chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his {hoes}, go to my door
Then they go to his flo, to love some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that [Chorus x2] [Verse 3 - R. Kelly]
Let's stop the bull{shit} baby
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that booty to me [Chorus until fade] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4, I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7, this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10, a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet Do you ever ask yourself, when are they ever gonna stop?
Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making those hits?
Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making us dance?
Do you ever ask yourself
When those bad boy are gonna stop making all this money? I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrero But for now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman Bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up
I got my Cuban mommy cooking up
We got it all from Heron to Fishscale New York to Ismail get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe, hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds, catch me if you can
I'm a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand They think I want a tan, I'm sittin' on a hundred grand
So I can hit the boat and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and hide the money in the tower
Stack blocks by the keys, L to the O to the X you'll see Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do

Dot on your head, take all your strength Yeah, I'm in it for the green

Tryin' to get in front of me playa, but you ain't gettin' none of me Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming B
When you want it? Now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators With my mega click, involved in Montega bricks

Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'
All that for frontin', what you gonna do? Nothin'
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write better nationalize I'm into gettin' money, twistin' hunnies
Niggaz is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that, that's why I never called her It's all about quick whips and fast knicks
Gats with mad clips, TV's in your whips
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle Get the facts, I'm tryin' to get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so ill shits match

It's all about respect Tek-9's and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with hunnies crushin' grapes So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Luchion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit so the town supports this
(Uh-hun) My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' rallies, and holdin' parades for the lifers groups
Now what you gon' do?
When they come for you The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing
And bubble gum chewing

Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me
(uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch Just me and my bitch Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherfucker yeah Bad boy baby

You're dead wrong Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face,
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits! Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin' Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong) "I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"

Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean? "I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"

Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any fagot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third,
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong "I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"
"I don't care what nobody say"

There's gonna be a lot of slow singin, and flower bringin

No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst

Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion

Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red

The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died I reach my peak, I can't speak,

Live niggaz respect it, check it I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya
Niggaz think Frankie pussy whipped, nigga picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tak
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga want to eat that, I'm fuckin' witchu
The bitch official doe, dick harder than a missile yo
Try to hit if she trippin dissapearin like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Why'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find a deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versacci heaven, when I'm up in em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, say I don't smoke it on homegrown
Then I heard her moan, honey I'm home
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad I know he won't like this
Now I'm like bitch you better talk to him
Before this fist put a spark to him
Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin closer
Gettin hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey bring me up somethin to drink!"
He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't want to blast her man
But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, "Don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prater knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggaz on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uh I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
in the everyday struggle I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
ain't tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin with the dope fiend binges, seein syringes
in the veins; hard to explain, how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third; rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes..
..and that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker Hah.. c'mon.. what you say? I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle

Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle Uhh, uhh

Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor! She did you a favor, c'mon now, yeah

To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that booty is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we lovin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger lovin in the park
{Piss}y off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo feet
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I {hit} that
Way she used to giggle when yo booty would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends [Chorus x2] [Verse 2 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo freakin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Chick keep yo chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his {hoes}, go to my door
Then they go to his flo, to love some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that [Chorus x2] [Verse 3 - R. Kelly]
Let's stop the bull{shit} baby
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that booty to me [Chorus until fade] Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges
To leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killin's clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies
Kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo' life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit' put bombs in yo' moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies
That all out
I got gats that blow the wall out
Clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout
Word is Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me
Fuckin' real
Here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14-5 a piece
Enough to cop six, by the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps
Brick a piece
Capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream
No one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1 point 5
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life
Frank pay attention
These muthafuckas is henchmen
Renegades, if you die they still get paid
Extra probably, fuck a robbery
I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on
Mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, caught a jooks
Heard it was sweet, 'bout 350 a piece
Ron bought a truck, 2 bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's the raw vantage, came back, speakin' spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, 20 carats
Here's a criminal
Nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby's mother's brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast, weeded
Took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated
He mean it
Nothing To Lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything, the game, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
'Specially if my daughter cryin', I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the signs Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol We agreed to go and shootin' silly
Because niggas could be hidin' in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked 'em
The telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in '91, stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place, long story
Glo' seen my face, got shook
Thought a nigga was comin' for the safe
Now she breakin', shut up, 112, what's shakin'
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear
They look gay
In a black Range Rover
Been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't leave
Ron, get the gasoline
This spot, we 'bout to blow
Let's get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats know
It's room 112
Right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline
The nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flammable
My hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two
Opposite sexes
One black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin' patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin'
I saw her brains hit the floor
Ron laughin'
I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least 12 times in the chest
Spint around, shot the chick in the breast
She cryin', headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin' but Franco faces
The spots hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin'
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin', pistol grippin'
I know they clippin'
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us
I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it
Through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

Notorious (There's only one crown) I make yo mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Little Cease
Nigga please
Blood floods your dungarees
And that's just a half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice
They see me in the streets they be like yo he nice
But that's on the low doe'
Be the cats wit no dough, tried ta play me at my show
I pull out 4-4's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas
Snort-cane niggas
Extortion came quicker
Bought the Range' nigga
Ya still tickle me
I used ta be as strong as ripple be, 'till Little Cease cripple me
Now I play hard-like my girls nipples be
The games sour like like a pickle be
Ya'll know da rules
Move from BK ta New Jerus
Thinkin' bout, all the planes we flew
Bitches, we ran through
Now da years new
I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Muthafuckas mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya

Blood rushing, concussions, ain't nothing
Catch cases, come out frontin'
Smokin' something
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'

6 TV's, a system, knockin' Mase shit, face it
We hard ta hit
Guard ya shit, for I stick you, for ya re-up
Wipe the pee up
Lick shots, woke his seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss Time, time for you to die
As I kiss your ass goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss your ass goodnight Uh, I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fuckin'
Maniacs put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke backwoods, and Duchies
You can't touch me
Try to rush me
Slugs go, touchy-touchy
Ya bleedin' lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, ya whole life ya live sneaky
Now ya rest eternally, sleepy, ya burn when ya creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
Wit the holy ghost
I put holes in most, you hold ya toast shakey
Slip-n-tryin' ta break me
Look what'chyou made me do, brains blue
My team in the marine-blue, six-coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out
The block for distances, givin' long kisses bitch Time, time for you to die
As I kiss your ass goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss your ass goodnight Frank White the menacing, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke, girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out 'til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too

Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest

Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit

Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
have his mother singing "It's so hard..."
Yes Love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
and bruised up from the pistol whipping
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant
I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit
so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps

Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent
Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
before you find out how blue steel feel
from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant "baka! baka! baka!"
So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it

("I'm a bad, bad, boy..")
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
("I'm a bad, bad, boy..") Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the Isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C.R.E.A.M
and if he start to scream "bam! bam!", have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
(Oh shit! The cops!) Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(So why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin in my business, what is this? Relentless
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we motherfuckin meet again
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick
The funk baby "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk baby "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" As I sit back relax
puff a blunt/sip a Becks
think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail
for fuckin Patti Labelle
oooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
wait a miniute what about my honey Mary
the jeans they fittin like a glove
i had a crush on you since Real Love
hold your horses
Ima show ya who the boss of intercourse is
sex Im takin no losses
even groups like SWV and TLC

the recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
pimpin aint easy but it's always fun
when I bust my nut
I bust em one by one

Dreams of fuckin an R&B; bitch

Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's, the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
HAH, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs drippin;
when I throw my clip in the A.K., I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jailcells
Oh my God I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fuckin shit spill
And I'm talkin bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
Cause I got mo' shots to pop-ya

Come on motherfuckers, come on I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick
To stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playin the villian
Prepare for this rap killin
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talkin bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
is here to excite and
throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless
Guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me [T-H-O-D Man]
You don't want to fuck with Biggie Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin
Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin

It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin down your god damn door [and it goes a lil somethin like this] Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on Verse two, comin with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.

Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it
[Assume the position] Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus [I got more glocks and techs than you]
I make it hot [Nigga won't even stand next to you]
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop

And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on Good evenin' ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G.
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him y'all Uh, a nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray (Uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
That hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid 'em, stole wid 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear, Oshkosh with blue and white ducks
Pass the blunt Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want Uh-huh, I was a shame, my crew was lame
I have enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go 'round
Plus I'm fuckin, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to English, pass off a global
The only nigga wit a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Ya brain was a terrible thing to waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggas, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker, see you chumps on top Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want

What you want, be what you want Yeah...
Yeah...
(You ready motherfucker?)
(We gon' kill your ass) As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
mic ripper girl stripper the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
the Q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big BAD motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes
to the Lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready I'm ready to die!
(Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet)
(We gonna make you suffer) In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin
You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left you swung a right you feel to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
after the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie Smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die! I'm ready
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggaz definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
for ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready! (Now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
(If I should die before I wake)
(I pray the Lord my soul to take)
(Cause I'm ready to die) (All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to) (Biggie Smalls the biggest man)
(Rockin on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee)
(Third Eye, and the rest of the Bad Boy fam)
(I don't wanna see no cryin at my funeral) Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me, all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Niggaz in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly, testing, coke measuring
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Mwa, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a little vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody til somebody kills you You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why) Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily, ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin'
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal
Til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminesce on dead friends too
You're nobody til somebody kills you You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why) You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why) You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range (I remember that)
Silly cat, all suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?) you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Darkskin Jermaine (see what I mean?) You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why) You're nobody, til somebody, kills you Yeah, dedicatin' this to my nigga O
We miss you nigga
Goin' out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas
Word up Each and every day
The daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're goin' through, oh yeah I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, rained on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with 'Half Steppin'
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon
We was king 'til the D's crept in
And now I'm missin' 'em Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why We work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me, fuck it
Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops comin', sick of throwin' jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route
Few months, he got his brains blown out
Now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy, you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I'd, look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
Damn I'm missin' her Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin' but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin', now Drew she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for

Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing, they know Big be handling
With the mac in the Ac' door paneling
Damagin MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you, but I have to, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot? Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievable Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable I'm sticking icepicks on the tip of your dick
give your testicles a swift kick
ain't that some shit
am I hard-hardcore
harder than the planet
it ain't no miss it's a nigger with a spliff
and a chrome-fu fist pressed on yo back
so what you want nigga how you wanna act
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die
brains all leaking out on the street
and the pastor preaching: he was a good man
played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
three to the head 'bout six cross the pelvis
you fuck with the high die you die
you're the same motherfucker
if you look up in the sky
I want some old nex shit
suplex shit hardcore section
protection a repetitive loop all I need to display
solo is the proof I put it to you boy
hope you got the scoop
biggie smalls the rap genius
I keep the glock by the penis
the cleanest cut fuck sluts
with the big humongous butts
I used to rub a butt
my style is Gucci like the hookers pussy
and it don't take a lot of black puff
to put me into flamin em
like that little nigga Damien
glock 19 to my mothafucking cranium
gang-thight gun toting motherfucker
niggas in they brains thought biggie was a sucker
I tricked em I gave me work then I snitched em
I stripped em cause niggas dont want the friction
told you before how I bring gun drama
playing Larry Johnson and his grand mama fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
when I get busy throw you hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality niggas be grabbing me
knowing that they rather be stabbing me all up in my back
tryna take my track
when i used to sell crack I aint had problems like that
street rules watch your pockets and your jewels
a nigga front throw a gat to the fool
next one to move is getting blasted
streets to a flows from the ill gettho bastard
as I release master peace it's like indecent
stuck to your ass like tissue when you're wiping fast
mc's have a hard time believing
I'm marked with death hard to kill like steven
with jacob I'm leaving
The black man's motto: you got a better chance playing lotto Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you want to see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin Bastard!
Cryin, know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed 'em, filled 'em with the Lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, day dreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be more gone than freemen
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screw faces, when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (What)
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, these Cristal chips
Bought to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggaz want my team to stop shinin'
Pray my fame start declinin'
Windin' like girlies
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
In moonlights, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start (What)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp A La Carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels
Octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack you
Give her a package to push, 'cause I work dem hoes
Pendejos, I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mill' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall [27 seconds of street noise to open the song then dialogue]
We run the city [Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like "True Lies," kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed [Chorus: Raekwon]
Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid [Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw [Chorus] [Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh [Raekwon]
Yo I think they tryin to do somethin man

Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name.. I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for.. Mafia For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is
for..
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggaz nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...
Niggaz tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga... To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name.. I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for.. Mafia Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barly able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account
All that material shit, ya'll still tryin to get it
Uh, you fuckin pricks, get off his dick tryin to be like...
All ya'll lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth
Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I, double G-I, E
Ya'll niggaz can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it sewn, we don't need ya'll help, we hold our own
Cause this goes out to cats not tryin to give it up
BIG missin us, shout him out... To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name.. I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for.. Mafia To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name.. I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for.. Mafia Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
Cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, "Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?"
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
(And you know that ain't right) You know that ain't right, with a friend of mine You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right You know that ain't right, with a friend of mine Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops! I'm interrupted by a doorbell 3:52, who the hell
Is this?
I gets up quick
Cock my shit Stop the dogs from barkin'
Then proceed to walkin'
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, he used to sling on the 16th floor Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that don't fucked Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' bout my man C-Rock Somebody gotta die
If I go, you gotta go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody gotta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Somebody gotta die
If I go, you gotta go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody gotta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Fillin' clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station, wagon Was braggin'
About how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew 'Round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was I?
Yeah, run out of town, blew the fuck up
D-Rock went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice Caught 'em right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He figured Rock set em up, no question
Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes "What kinda gats?"
"Heckler & Koch and Calicos"
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin'
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you comin' Somebody gotta die
If I go, you gotta go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody gotta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Somebody gotta die
If I go, you gotta go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody gotta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs
And make 'em catch the man n shit
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the nigga they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One niggas in my eye That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin'
Scream his name out Squeeze six knuckles shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter Throw your hands in the sky, nigga
I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core, harder than a Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with the spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' "He was a good man"
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' "Look up in the sky!"

Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts
Huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggaz in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em

Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt

Just like tasting pussy with pork in it
People stop, when I'm walking in
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking

Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me

Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference? It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall All I do all day is drink Tanguray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger You'd better slow your role, baby
You ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pen number, just page me
When you're real, baby Damn Ma, I love you like a lot

Honeys wanna chat but all we wanna know is where the party at
And I can bring ma GAT, if not I hope i dont get shot
Better throw my vest on ma chest cause ni**as is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin for me to start something
buggin and buckin at ni**as like I was duck huntin
dumbin out just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is (The rockaway) Chorus:
ma ni**as dont dance they just pull their pants and do the rockaway
Lean Back (Brooklyn)
Lean Back (Uptown)
Lean Back (Queensbridge)
Lean Back (Bronx)
say Ma ni**as dont dance they just pull up their pants and do the rockaway
Lean Back, Lean Back, Lean Back Verse 2:

F**k up the party before it even start
Is he drunk over henny and skunk
Or some brand newbian shit beating down punks Chorus Verse 3:
B**ches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress I think I might just
Hit her wit a little Biggie one-on-one
how to tote a GUN and have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation, ma men big Jock got the GLOCK in his waist and was smokin, drinking got the Hooker thinking
If money smell bad then this ni**a biggie's stinkin
is it ma charm I got the Hookers eating out ma palm
She grabbed ma arm and said let's leave calm
Im hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a heineken
Ni**as start to Loc out, a kid got choked out
blows was thrown and a F**KING fight broke out
Cant we just all get along?
So I can put hickeys on ya chest like lil' Shawn Chorus [Puffy background]
What about ten years from now? [Biggie]
Ten years from now, where do I want to be? I want to be...just livin' man, just
Living comfortably with my niggas man, in a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo

You know I'm saying? Living all my niggas is living where I think I be? Ten

We got Da Brat in the house
And me, y'all know who I be
Check it ... I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to
Funk for your trunk is what I provide you
So slide through your hood with me in your deck
Cause your correct way to get your groove on FLOMPS
And I paid the costs to be the boss as a kid
Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again
Back with the Big and my new-found friend Sliding in from the front, never way behind
Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine
Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip
Brat and Biggie Smalls... Aw, shit!
On top of all that, I'm so, so remarkable,
Flow to make you motherfuckers know
Ain't an MC coming close to touch
Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so... Lay on back, light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want Lay on back, light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want I never knew, niggas had a clue
On who was the king of the street
More deep than a Range Rover jeep, guns under the seat
And my nigga just came home from work, release
Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air
(Brat: Nigga, pass that shit like you just don't care)
Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs
when I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist
Nigga, no human being, Korean or European

Is far from weak -- Brat-tat-tat, please speak ...
(Brat: Nigga, close your eyes, cause you already see
the Notorious B-R-A-T)
The raw combination, the destination,
Number one tote a gun with no hestiation
Live with the funkdafied cutie pie
Gat by the thigh, the Smalls by her side
If you fuck with her you got to fuck with me
And we'll be rapping at your motherfuckin' eulogy, so ... Lay on back, light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want Brat-tat-tat-tat, please speak ... I got the funk in my pocket, shit stay locked down
The nigga you know who represent them platinuim sounds
Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy
Didn't find nuthin but truth, in the hook B
You're pledging to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die
jump in the Benz, took me a little ride
round the mountain, broke a left, hit SoSoDef
and told the nigga JD I was the one, fuck the rest
We Funkdafied, kicking it live
Robin Leach teach a nigga how to really survive
Whether it be track or blunt, ain't no need to front
Got what you need, and I take everything you ever wanted, nigga
We comin' mass, his pimpin' ass, his glass is full of Moet
The Rolex is bar-bayed, parkade, B to the R-A, T
Rolling off swoll on chrome 17 Lay on back, light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want Lay back, listen to the B-Side
Slide, glide, do whatever you want
Get out your lighters
We be the rhyme writers
Starters ... from the heart of College Park,
New York, Chicago ... wherever you wanna go What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game you see through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', two trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin In My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistic tunes
Or the O-Jays, thinkin' bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you? Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We be all fuckin' tonight What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black, nasty and mad fat y'all
Shoulda seen the hoe, nigga pack ya shit
You out the door, ohh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin' fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court, couldn't think straight
Thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, you can have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see nine outta ten nigga, ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canape
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?

1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' 1970 somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, Tanqueray and Hennesey,
Until I call Earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York, New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st, 2:19 was when my momma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out i'm bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be Bad Boy! I remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye,
With the right I visualized, the king of Bed-Stuy,
Checkin' his daughter Tianna into junior high,
If I was in Brooklyn, and B.I. Was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.&. 718 212, where Sue's rendevouz,
Its like Moulin Rouge,
High fashion, up town Air Force Ones,
And Vasquez, Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S Classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to Manhattan,
With that Broadway actin', you hype that
belly shit'd get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Rog' what's happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the Magnum I remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail, I remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere Push
C'mon shorty stay push c'mon
C'mon c'mon push it's almost there
One more time c'mon C'mon push baby one more time
Harder harder push harder

Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo c'mon nigga, cut that)
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo, yoyo Big, ayo chill)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin ' (Ayo Big, ayo BIG!!) Damn! We was supposed to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no

I know you hear me nigga

Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
Live your life "Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."
"Meth-Tical.."
"Biggie.. Biggie.." (mmmhmmmmmm) Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
the prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high Yo.. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high "This rule is so underrated.."
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin"
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.."
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon"
"This rule is so underrated.."
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin"
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.."
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
from Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit
niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
in and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
and three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin swords in the WAR
that's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
and touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
to kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)
