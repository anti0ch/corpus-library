[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cuz I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,
The way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z (Beyonce)]
Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh, (oh)
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only,
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony, Soprano, (oh no)
The ROC handle like Van Axel,
I shake phoneys man, You can't get next to,
The genuine article I go I do not sing though,
I sling though, If anything I bling yo,

Star like Ringo, war like a green berret
Crazy bring your whole set,
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane, (oh no)
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla.
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers,
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over,
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
to platinum the game's been wrap, One!

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cuz your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby
HEY!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's (oh love)

[Intro (Big Boi)]
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town’s up, deuces down it’s the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I’m your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something

Ain’t no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I’m a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It’s the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move

I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I kick it tight

I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get messy?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bamboos on pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Undress me, undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them dripping down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!

A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in ‘em, let me P pop that thang

First check her brain to see if she’s sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!

[Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel oh girl I know its bout to be.....
Me all on you and damn girl you all over me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star


Ooh baby
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing i won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when i'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothin
Saving it all for you
Baby i love making love to you
It's like a high i can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you oh yea
Boy i rather be with you
I'd rather be with you oh yea
Boy i rather be with you 

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I don't want nobody else
I ain't goin no where
I'm happy with you
You got me baby
I ain't thinking about
Nobody else but you baby


All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out...

I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of 
One day having your kids
Love is so blind 
It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on

Cuz I realized I got 
Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you said that you love me 
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend 
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time 
But now I am strong

Because I realized I got 
Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
I know that I will never disappoint myself
I must have cried a thousand times
All the ladies if you feel me
Help me sing it now
I can't regret all the times spent with you
Ya, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
I know that I will never disappoint myself

[Repeat to end]


I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time i said no
Its like I never said yes

I said yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully
The first time I said no
Its like I never said yes

You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watching me baby
I was watching you
Slowly you walked over 
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you

You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You some how intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So i gave my number to you

I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
Its like I never said yes

I said yes we can be together 
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully 
The first time I said no
Its like I never said yes

Certainly you can call me baby
I love to here from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I wanna get to know you more
Sure I'm feeling you
No baby, not yet
We can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset, boy you
Act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
ummm ummm ummm

You was at my house 
I was sitting on the couch
You was really buggin
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move to slow
I showed you to the door
You said you call me later
I said don't call no more
Its cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
Cuz you showed me your true face baby
The first time I said no

[Repeat chorus untill fade]

Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that
That’s how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, it’s a fact
That’s how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain’t

It levels me, so please don’t ever change

That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh

Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don’t let‘em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt wrong before
This can’t be what it feel like
And they don’t really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don’t know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain’t mad at you, it’s just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That’s why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah & the Letter B
How you like that, huh?

That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How I Like It, baby


The closer i get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside , i knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more (more and more)
Let's give love a try

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way

Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love
Just a little closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
Cuz i wanna tell you something
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving


I love you... I love you... I love you

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am a seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and mixed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you

Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
Sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you
You set me free

Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love
To hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you

Dangerously in love
I can't do this thing
I love you, I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me

[talking]
I believe that harmonies are colors

Every time I paint it sharpens my harmony
Yesterday I tried to paint you 

But the colors weren't beautiful enough

Your love goes beyond what I can say

Love,
Beyonce


I wish i could look in your eyes
And tell you how i feel 
Right now inside
Baby i know that it's real
So real so real, so real
How i wish i could be with you
How i wish i wish i wish i could be with you right now

Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you
From your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

Do you remember our first kiss
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time 
We spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say good-bye
I never want to say good-bye
I never ever want to say good-bye

One day we'll make love
Finally i'll be yours
Only you only you 
I could love you
It's too late 
I already love you
I love you 
I love you
I love you


[Talking]
Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the westside - highway
Doing what we like to do - our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

[Chorus:]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus]

[Beyonce]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus]


How you doing honey baby
You know I don't ask for much but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I hear a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

[Chorus:]
Is y'all alright 
I don't know but I know what's happening to me girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now

See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

Child, blow your horn now
Come on, Child, blow your horn now

So we shakin back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to, you got to keep on strumming babe
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time
We if there ain't nobody loving and you goin keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine

[Chorus]

I like this!
Uh, look it here...BRIDGE!

So baby hold me 
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy
Cause boy you working it out
Daddy you given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole bee hive
I'm gonna call you my sugar 
Cause I (I) had the sweetest time
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

I like it when the horn go [x4]

Ha! Austin better work it out
Ha! Foxy better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out


I remember when you use to take me on a
Bike ride everyday on the bayou (You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend (My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said Beyonce I told you so
Instead you said you'd get one too (Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord why did you pick me
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)

I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy...

He got his crew, but I got mine too
Send a note to my table like, what you gonna do
Eye game got him spreadin' me out
In my ear dry tears, how he left his spouse
And oh, the nice cars, and impressive house
He want to run up in, I ain't no regular route (Hoooo!)
Me and the girls, we ain't stressin' out
We ain't birds, we ain't headin' south (Noooo!)
Them one nighters, that's sad and doubt
That little talk on da creep ,what you said is out
I gets cheddar, to help me do what ever
No beef with Dennis Edwards, but I fight temptation
I'm not sayin' I don't like temptation
I'm just lookin' for da right temptation, ya kno'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - MC Lyte]

If you should decide, to get closer (Hooo!)
Well then this dance, is straight over

And Juliet felt the same 
When he put his arms around her 
He said Julie baby you're my flame 
Thou give me fever 
When we kisseth 
A fever with the flaming youth 
Fever I'm on fire 
Fever yeah, I burn forsooth 

Captain Smith and Pocahontas 
Had a very mad affair 
When her daddy tried to kill him 
She said Daddy, oh don't you dare 
He gives me fever 
With his kisses 
Fever when he holds me tight 
Fever 
I'm his Mrs. 
And Daddy won't you treat him right 

Now that you've listened to my story 
Here's the point that I have made 
Chicks were born to give ya fever 
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade 
They give ya fever 
When ya kiss em 
Fever if you live ya learn 

Fever until you sizzle 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
Fever 
Til ya sizzle 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to... 
Burn

[Chorus:]
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan,
And WHAT did I see,
Comin' for to carry me home,
A band of angels comin' after me,
Comin' for to carry me home.

[Repeat chorus:]

If you get there before I do,
Comin' for to carry me home,
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too,
Comin' for to carry me home.


Took me a while 
But I'm finally here 
So I just wanna testify 
Make it crystal clear 
See I've been picked out 
To be picked on

Til he turned my life around

I aint no superstar 
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
(no no no no no) 
cuz I aint good enough 
but he still loves me 
Loves me 

I used to wake up somedays 
and wish i'd stayed asleep 
cuz i went to bed on top of the world

They aint been in my position 
(they don't care)

have to say about me yeah

Shunned by the world

If you aint worthy just raise your hands 
And let me know that you understand 
That we are all so blessed 
To be loved, loved

What will we do 
Without out pain 

Feels like we always fall short 
Of bein worthy (we are not worthy) 
Cuz I aint good enough

It doesn't matter where you been 
Or what you did wrong 

It doesn't matter who you are 
You're always welcome 
It only matters that your heart believes 
And you confess 

If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven 

Callin on all of God's children 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be delivered 
Time to come home 
I've been rescued by the savior 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be in His favor 
Time to come home 

Come on home 
Come on come on home 
oooh yeah yeah 
come on home 

If you cant see your way out 
And you're drowning in your regrets 

If you have everything you want 
But you still cant find happiness 

Cuz when you feel like you're forsaken 
Life can be so hopeless 

Maybe you need to come home 
So your life can be planned 

Oooh 

God's children 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be delivered 
Time to come home 
I've been rescued by the savior 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be 
you need to be 
Time to come home 

Don't bare the burden all by yourself 
(By yourself) 
The Redeemer's here He's gonna give you help 
(Give you help) 
Come unto him and he will give you rest 
For any heart that's heavy laden for salvation 
ooh 

Calling all God's children 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be delivered 
Time to come home 
I've been rescued by the savior 
Time to come home 
If you wanna be in his favor 
Time to come home 

My home 
Your home 
In his everlasting arms 
My home

In his everlasting arms 
Don't you know its time to come home

[P. Diddy - talking]
Yeah
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

[Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Break - Beyonce]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

[Chorus - Beyonce]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

[Beyonce]
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Break - Beyonce]
I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
and felt our love begin

[Chorus]

[P. Diddy]
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..

[Chorus]


[Intro:]
[Beyonce:] Bass
[Jay-Z:] Uh
[Beyonce:] Hi hat

[Beyonce:] 808
[Jay-Z:] Uh
[Beyonce:] Jay
[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
Ready?
Uh-huh
[Beyonce:] Let's go get 'em
[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
C'mon

[Jay-Z Rap]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B ([Beyonce:] Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

[Verse 1]
Baby seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Verse 2]
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Jay-Z Rap 2]
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tipping like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh

[Bridge]
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu


[Verse 1:]

Like we do it all the time we gonna do it again (hey)
Mission four

Drop a couple hundreds tell him leave it at the door

[Pre-Chorus:]
I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While you all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (hey)

[Chorus:]
Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight

I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?

Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

[Jay-Z:]
(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me they watching
and we just yachting off the island hopping off
Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

[hook:]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me
Partner let me upgrade you

[Hook:]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus:]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

[Verse 1:]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most?
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

[Chorus]


You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags
We're finished
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable


I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me

I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinking
What's up with b
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying
Can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
Look at what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
You lied
How could you lie
You lied


Baby I see you
That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking
mysterious style
exotically tempting
familiar to me
That Creole Sexy it's all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor
and all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and call it Creole
[Repeat 2x]

Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good
whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE

When she look that good
whenever she talk that good
whenever she bounce real good
Ladies if you wanna know it's your secret CREOLE

Bad bad bad bad red bone
bad bad bad bad yellow bone
bad bad bad bad brown bone

For all of my brown bones

And all of my red bones that make a good sauce

So all my red bones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor
and all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and call it Creole
[Repeat 2x]

Creole! When I look real good

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra
because this album was so special to me
and ut came so effortlessly.
after I finished the film of my life dream girls
because I was so inspired by Dina
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
that I wish she would have said in the film.
and I wanted to give you an extra special song
that Dina sings it's a pivotal moment when Dina finally does,
get the strength to stand up for herself and does,
know who she is and knows what she wants.
Im sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics.
This is, listen.


Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

[Chorus:]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

[Chorus:]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags
We're finished
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me
I'll follow this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see you hustle wit my hustle I
Can keep you
Focused on your focus I can feed you

[bridge:]
You need a real woman in your life
That's a good look
Taking care
Home is still fly
That's a good look
I'm gonna help you build up your account
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Ladies that's a good look

When you're in the big meetings for the mills
That's a good look
It take me just to compliment the deal
That's a good look
Anything you cop I'll split the bill
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Ladies that's a good look

[chorus]

[Jay-Z:]
(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me they watching
and we just yachting off the island hopping off
Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

[hook:]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me
Partner let me upgrade you

You switch your neckties to purple labels
Upgrade you

Partner let me upgrade ya grade ya
Partner partner let me upgrade ya grade ya
Let me let me let me upgrade ya grade ya
Partner partner partner let me upgrade ya (huh...)


I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes in deed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

[Chorus]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you [3x]

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

[Chorus]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
and that's why I love you [3x]

[Repeat Chorus]


[Verse 1:]
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like i'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

[Verse 2:]
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you
He pays more attention to me lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

[Bridge:]
Boy when i try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy i'm not a fool

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (no no)
That your love was never true (no no)
If you let him take me from you 
(how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you

If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you


I'm so in love
I'm still in love

I've never been in love quite before

When we make love I can feel all your spirits
deep inside of me
Baby you're so pure

I'm Kissing you forever, and ever, and ever
I love Kissing you (kissing you, kissing you)

Boy I love everything about you baby

[Intro:]
[Beyonce:] Bass
[Jay-Z:] Uh
[Beyonce:] Hi hat
[Jay-Z:] Uh
[Beyonce:] 808
[Jay-Z:] Uh
[Beyonce:] Jay
[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
Ready?
Uh-huh
[Beyonce:] Let's go get 'em
[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
C'mon

[Jay-Z Rap]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B ([Beyonce:] Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

[Verse 1]
Baby seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Verse 2]
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Jay-Z Rap 2]
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tipping like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh

[Bridge]
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu


[Hook:]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus:]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

[Verse 1:]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most?
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

[Chorus]


I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me

I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinking
What's up with b
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying
Can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
Look at what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
You lied
How could you lie
You lied


Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

[Chorus:]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

[Chorus:]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención debes oír
Hoy no sé quién soy ni sé adónde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

[Chorus:]
Oye...
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Oye...
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a por ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

[Chorus]

Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

[Chorus x2]

Oye...
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
llena de valor hoy ya lo decidí
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz


Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya loves

Ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé
en el closet, en un rincón
están tus cosas, esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
no te quiero ya, ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás, te puedes marchar
y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
a olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé de dolor, ya te saqué de mi corazón
vete con ella, solos los dos
pobre de ti, lárgate, me das asco
Tu eres mi luz
pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
voy a olvidar tu amor

Ya no soy nada para ti
alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó)
Nunca lloraré por ti
porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
te olvidé, te olvidé

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé

Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (baby) No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(No hay más que hablar, terminamos)
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (Este cuento al fin se he acabado) No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
voy a olvidar tu amor

Miente, lo ves
Es un juego
(Yo conosco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
Sabe decir lo que
Quieres oir
Un bello embustero
(solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)
A mi tambien
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer 
En su trampa una vez mas

[CHORUS:]
No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

Nos va dividir? NO!
No nos va a exitar
Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontre
Besandote el cuello
(pero el no lo podia creer las dos caimos en su red)
Por que a ti?
si hay mil por ahi
El es un perro
(las dos sin querer caimos presas en su piel)
A mi tambien
siempre quiere verme sola
no hay que caer
en su trampa una vez mas

[CHORUS:]
No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos

Lo creia tan mio
Yo vivia por el
Fuimos un desafio
Que pudo mas que el
es un hombre muy frio
no es de una mujer

Ya no nos puede engañar
Haremos con su juego, ya basta... de sus mentiras
Dile adios por las dos

[CHORUS:]
No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

Nos va dividir? NO!
No nos va a exitar
Vamos a sufrir?

[Verse]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I’d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I’d never get confronted for it.
'Cause they’d stick up for me.

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man.
I’d listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it’s broken
So they’d think that I was sleepin’ alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home (to come home)

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man.
I’d listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he’s taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It’s a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I’d forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you’re just a boy
You don’t understand
Yeah, you don’t understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

But you’re just a boy


Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again

And it's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...


If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by...

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good it's got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear

I missed all the signs, one at a time...
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives...
Now my love, I'm ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear


You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could have been
But still you live inside of me,
So tell me how is that?

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart,
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now, while I hate you,
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

There's something that I feel I need to say
But up til' now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out

You say you've got the most respect for me
But, sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still, you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And yes, there are times when I hate you,
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you..., yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

No broken-hearted girl


She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide.
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never thought that grace of God, oh I...

I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside...
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans.
Suddenly hits you, and then you realize
It's out of your hands...
Baby, you've got to understand

You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria


Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
And smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
Cause' I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh...

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh......

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh...I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you


Satellites
Flashing by.....
It's a beautiful state were in
But, how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try

We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side

In your eyes, love's alive
I've come untied 'cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites......

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display...let's run and hide

In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites......

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

Satellites.....
Flashing by.....
Satellites.....


Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why....
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I....
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love...that could be us..."

Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love......
Wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I....
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love...that could be us..."

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us..
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh
Why, why
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful


I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me.
I guess I'm their soldier.
Well, who's gonna be mine

[Chorus:]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help.
Who's there to save the hero
Who's there to save the girl...
After she saves the world
After she saves the world.

I bottle all my hurt inside,
I guess I'm living in lie.
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

[Chorus]

I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would
Just come here and save me...
Save me from myself

[Chorus]


Si yo fuera un chico, 
sólo por una vez
yo me vestiría como quiero, 
con lo que vea primero y me voy. 
Saldría a buscar
chicas por montón
mis amigos que son leales
siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
cada noche a mentir. 

[CHORUS]
Si yo fuera un chico
sé que podría saber
comprender mucho mejor
lo que es amar a una mujer
sabría escuchar
pues conozco el dolor
de perder a quien se quiere
porque ignoras lo que tienes
y quedas sin saber que pasó

Si yo fuera un chico
pero ves no lo soy
los chicos son de un molde
y nosotras somos de corazón
se piensan que son
los del sexo superior
pero cuando lo queremos
nos vence nuestra seducción

[CHORUS]

Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
el lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más. 

Pero eres un chico
que le vas a hacer
no puedes comprender
que se siente al comprender mejor
y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
no te importa el dolor
hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
porque ignoras lo que tienes
y quedas sin saber que pasó

Pero eres un chico.


All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
don't pay him any attention
Cause I cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

[Chorus:]
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
And now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

[Chorus]

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

[Chorus x2]

Wuh uh oh


I be on the hotline, like erryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh 
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room 
With the door closed we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go BOOM
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out of my window 
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
(With my stereo-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing OH!
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ
(Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart.....

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 

I be on the hotline, like erryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh 
Turn up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Oh ooh whoa whoa...
Oh ooh whoa whoa...
Oh ooh whoa whoa, ooh.......

(Turn the lights on!)
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

(Turn the lights on!)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

(Turn the lights on!)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain....
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Turn the lights out

I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stops
Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

Baby when you
Stole my cool
Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh

I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cause you know there's more to life
If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
Just want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello

Aw, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than YOU?
You feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or, you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you're a sight to see
Kinda something like me

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up,
I can back it up
I Walk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego... such a huge ego
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Ego so big you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...


I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely...

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream , I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials...
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got @ss
And you don't even care to care
Looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now 
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh.....

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain....... DUMB

[Verse 1:]
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you

The death of me
Must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss,
You're snatching every bit of strength

That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

[Chorus:]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2:]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat lines

Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?

How many doses am I needin' now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

[Chorus:]
Baby, you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 3:]
It's just not my body (oh),
It's my mind you don't know how many times I told myself this can't do (can't do)
And that I don't need you
(No, I don't need you, no)

It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus:]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't want it but I do

You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time

You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you,
I don't wanna do

You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die


If you search 
For tenderness 
It isn't hard to find 
You can have the love 
You need to live 
But if you look 
For truthfulness 
You might just 
As well be blind 
It always seems to be 
So hard to give 

[Chorus:]
Honesty 
Is such a lonely word 
Everyone is so untrue 
Honesty 
Is hardly ever heard 
And mostly 
What I need from you 

I can always 
Find someone 
To say 
They sympathize 
If I wear my heart 
Out on my sleeve 
But I don't want 
Some pretty face 
To tell me 
Pretty lies 
All I want 
Is someone 
To believe 

[Chorus]

I can find a lover 
I can find a friend 
I can have security 
Until the bitter end 
Anyone can comfort me 
With promises again 
I know, I know 

When I'm deep 
Inside of me 
Don't be 
Too concerned 
I won't ask 
For nothin' 
While I'm gone 
But when I want 
Sincerity 
Tell me where else 
Can I turn 
Because 
You're the one 
That I depend upon 

[Chorus]


If I ain't got nothing
I got you
If I ain't got something (I don't give a damn)
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra (but I know)
One plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through ('cause baby)

We ain't got nothing without love
Darling you got enough for the both of us (so come on baby)

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all (right now baby)

Make love to me (me, me, me, me) oh, oh
Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns but I
I've been shot by you (hey)
And I don't know when I'm gon' die but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you (hey)
And I don't know much about fighting but I
I know I will fight for you (hey)
And just when I ball up my fist I realize
I'm laying right next to you baby

We ain't got nothing but love
And darling you got enough for the both of us

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all (help me let down my guard)

Make love to me (me, me, me, me) oh, oh
Make love to me (me, me, me, me)


I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care. Well, that's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)

Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour
You won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care. That's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
I still care
I still care
I still care (ah)


I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you... around

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything


What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around...

There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out

[Chorus:]
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna' always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby good lookin' out

[Chorus:]
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby I bet sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus:]
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be (the best thing I never had)
And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, best thing you never had!

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh, I will never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now


You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' till the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
Cause tonight's the night Oh Oh Oh Oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' till the morning light
Cause we like to party!

[Rap: Andre 3000]
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me baby, I make it milk till it drip down yo knees
Spit this shit fo' rillo, brain brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' I try to pray
Grandmom 'n' them, they never forgot, and nothin' else really mean none to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fuckin' with me? Move on, ain't none to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men
And that they fell in love with rap, black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night
That I give you everything
Music knockin' till the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh ooh


Boy you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast, you smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm addicted to the rush

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I ever seen
That burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you
'Cause this might be a last night, oh

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I rather give up everything
Than to live my life without you

Ooh... Oh!
Ooh... Oh!

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you 
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you


I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say I still love you

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there
Maybe you like it, well I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We both know that this love won't die

Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life


Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.

Come on baby it's you.

You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you make everything stop.
Finally you put my love on top.

Ooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
You put my love on top.
Ooh oooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
My love on top.
My love on top.

Baby, Baby
I can hear the wind whipping past my face.
As we dance the night away.
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne.
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again.

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears.
And finally you put me first.

You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because

I was here

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved (I loved)
I was here (oh)
I did, I've done

I was here

Help me raise a glass for the college grads

This goes out to all the women getting it in,
You're on your grind
To other men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine

How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me
Oh, come here baby
Hope you still like me

My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power
With our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

When I'm here in your arms I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself
I don't care I'm with you, you're with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in the dreams.

[Bridge:]
When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me,
Ohh.

[Chorus:]
Let me know, if this is a dream,
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.
Let me know, if this is a dream,
Then I ain't letting go, (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you babe, about you babe
So I rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh,
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
Is like I'm where I supposed to be.

[Bridge:]
When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can't fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me,
Ohh.

[Chorus:]
Let me know, if this is a dream,
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.
Let me know, if this is my dream,
Then I ain't letting go, (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you babe, about you babe
So I rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh,
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you baby
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in breathe you in
And if I am dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I rather dream about you than be living life without me and you

[Chorus:]
Let me know, if this is a dream,
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.
Let me know, if this is my dream,
Then I ain't letting go, (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you babe, about you babe
So I rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh,
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh


Don't you worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you,
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face,
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend

Part of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Takin time out, starting with today,
For my babe!

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'm a DJ all of your songs
Don't you worry 'bout a club,

When it comes to my baby I bring my best
It's just you and me all night,
Don't worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!

Ten years together still feels like we're making love for the first time,
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend!

All of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today,
For my babe!

Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uhu, just let me look at you!

Just come and lay up under me tonight!

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
While I'm a DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!

Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club,
Just come and lay up under me tonight!


This is for them 20 somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30 somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40 somethings
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50 somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby take it to the head

Mom and dad tried to hide the world
Said, the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made them want me more
At 14 they asked me what I wanna be,
I said "Baby 21, so I'd get me a drink."

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Schoolin' life...
Oh oh oh...
Schoolin' life...

This is for them pretty somethings
Living in a fast lane, see you when you crash babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get ya out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Schoolin' life...
Oh oh oh...
Schoolin' life...

You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshalls shut this sucker down

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Oh oh oh...
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember stay relentless... oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished, yeah yeah... yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Yea

I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, oh, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, oh, yes
Wanna show you how much I value what you say,
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, oh, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart,
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, oh, yes
Show you, show you, show you, till you through with me,
I wanna keep it how it is so you can never say how it used to be!

[Hook:]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night,
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe,
Swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on my babe
Baby let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's 'bout to go down!

[Verse 2:]
You'll never need 2 'cause I will be your number 1
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy you know what's up!

[Hook:]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night,
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe,
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on you babe
I'm gonna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down!

[Verse 3]
Imma take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize or describe the love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
When I'm grinding on you, this is beyond sex
Boy I'm high on you, and if it's real
Then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking, on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe,
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past,
And a chance to make this love last, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe,
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on you babe
I'm wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down, oh!

[Outro:]
Watch me pop it, pop it, p-p-p-p-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!
Me pop it, pop it, p-p-p-p-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Yes

Oh, yes
Oh, yes

[Harvey Keitel:] Ms. Third ward, your first question - what is your aspiration in life?
[Beyoncé:] Oh... My aspiration in life... would be... to be happy.

(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)

[Verse 1:]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl.
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth.
What you wear is all that matters."

[Pre-Hook:]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

(Uh huh huh)

[Verse 2:]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says, "Bigger is better."
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says, "Thinner is better."

[Pre-Hook:]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge:]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst (pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Outro:]
When you're alone all by yourself (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lying in your bed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

You stripped away the masquerade (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

Yes
Uh huh huh

The winner is
Beyonce Knowles female pop vocalist!

[Intro:]
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

[Verse 1:]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm torn
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around around around around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around around around around

Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Mm

[Verse 2:]
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You're lucky
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 3:]
My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
You must be onto me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)

[Outro:]
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)


[Intro - Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

[Verse 1 - Beyoncé]
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Hook - Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen saying,
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love

[Bridge - Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2 - Beyoncé]
We be all night,
And everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking,
Park it in my lot 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
[Studio version:] Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy toys
[Video/Live version:] Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
(I'm nice right now)
Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up,
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

[Bridge]

[Verse 4 - Beyoncé]
Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

[Bridge]


[Intro:]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1:]
I kiss you when you lick your lips, (I kiss you and you lick your lips)
You like it wet and so do I, (You like it wet and so do I)
No you never waste a drip, (No you never waste a drip)
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook:]
(Keep me coming, keep me going), keep me coming, keep me going
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning), keep me humming, keep me moaning
(Non-stop love until the morning), Non-stop love until the morning
(Non-stop screaming, freakin', blowin') Blow-o-o

[Hook:]
Can you eat my skittles
It's the sweetest in the middle
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle

I'm a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2:]
When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up till I'm empty baby
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, I'll fill it up to the top, baby
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Outro Hook]


Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're

Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're

Angel
Either, baby

Tell me do you want to ride
Tell me do you want to ride
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
You ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First both of my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
You're

No, no, no, no... [repeat til end]


[Verse 1:]
See me up in the club with 50-leven girls
Posted in the back diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin' babe

[Breakdown:]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin' babe [x2]
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (how it's looking)
And tell me how I'm lookin', babe (lookin' babe)

[Verse 2:]
Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up, " I just go slower
High like treble, puffin' on them mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor [x4]
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor [x3]
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

[Beat switch]
Drop!

[Verse 3:]
Driver roll up the partition please [x2]
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Luwinski'd all on my gown

Whoa dere daddy, daddy didn't bring a towel
Oh, baby, baby we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook:]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

[Verse 4:]
Driver roll up the partition fast [x2]
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Hand prints and footprints on my glass
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip filth talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping tryin' not to crash

Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' on my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook]

Hello!

[French:]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe. Je veux dire, l'activité physique.
Le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe,
Mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.
[English translation:]
Do you like sex?
Sex. I mean, the physical activity.
Coitus. Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
Men think that feminists hate sex,
But it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love.

[Hook]

Hello!


[Verse 1:]
I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise,
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling.
That's because I'm jealous

[Hook:]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

[Post-Hook:]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself,
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."

[Verse 2:]
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
'Yoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out the night tonight
I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]

No, no, no.

[Bridge:]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

[Hook]


Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like you can touch it, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?

Grab a hold,
Don't let go
Let me know
That you ready
I just wanna
Show you now
Slow it down
Go around
You rock hard
I rock steady

[Hook:]
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Could you put it in your face
By the way if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls

[Hook]
So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady rock hard
Rock steady

Don't you know that I give you
The loving if you need it
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons
Growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls down
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now
Yes lord
Damn baby
You're driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that, daddy
Even though I've been a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad girl

[Verse 1 - Beyonce:]
I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
You're still so fine
All mine...
All mine...
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh

Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far...
If we are...
We're taking this a little too far...
Baby if we are...
We're taking this a little too far...

With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...

[Intro:]
Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyoncé, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley
The Hip-Hop Rappin'
'Girls TYME'

I'm out that H-town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, H-Town, Town, I'm coming down
Coming, coming down, dripping candy on the ground

[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown!)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)

[Verse 2: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls,
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

[Verse 3 Beyonce:]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless

My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine, I'm flawless!

[Verse 4 Beyonce:]
You wake up, flawless

When the palm of my two hands, hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is, hmmm
And when my voice is screaming out, to my own ears, uh
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show ya
I guess I didn't see myself before ya

They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey

Down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2:]
And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared

Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it in heaven
Amen]


[Verse 1:]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

[Hook:]
Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

[Verse 2:]
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's just live it up

[Hook 2x]

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Hook:]
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart

[Hook:]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Verse 2:]
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

[Outro:]
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top

[Outro Skit - Tina Knowles:]
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive


[Intro: Beyonce]
I love your face
You love the taste

I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I

I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook: Beyonce]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Hook: Beyonce]
Can you eat my skittles?

Flavor

If you're thirsty and in love just hit your boy
I'm your milk man at your door
When you phone me I can see you with your cup
I'm just role playing
(Must be good to you)

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Interlude: Beyonce]
I'm about to get into this, girls
This is for all the grown women out there

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Ooh I've had a naughty thought today, baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don’t slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe
I know everything you want
I'm-a show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bring ya work home on top of me
I'm-a let you be the, be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

[Bridge]

[Pre-Outro:]
Je ne sais quoi
Cherie, m'vle-ou

Your body turn up, me say "Turn up, turn up"
[?] like the sun, so you turn up, Beyonce

My body is magnified
In the sun, set me alight
My body and your delights
Burn me up, set me alight

I can't deny your desire
Feel like I'm on fire
When, you touch me
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me

Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel, all my lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
(Feel everything
Standin' on the sun) [x4]

Let's get to huggin' and kissin'
Don't know the floor from the ceilin'
We cooked it up in the kitchen
Nobody hotter than you
You know that I'm twerkin'
And give you somethin' that's worth it
But d-d-daddy that's perfect
This 'yoncé only for you
All that ocean, can't you see it?
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
BB Cubana, I que lindo
Ya tu sabes camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I wanna love you long time
Want you to watch me while I wind
Want you to love me long time
We're just havin' such a good time
Over and over we find
With the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me

You can taste the dishonesty, it's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier, but even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all, my lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me

I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doin my love?


Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'm a fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing say

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

Looking at my watch he should've been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the lord you reveal what his truth is

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby we gone be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call becky with the good hair
He better call becky with the good hair


[Beyoncé:]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

[The Weeknd:]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
She already made enough but she'll never leave

[Beyoncé:]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
She works for the money

She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby you know, she got them commas and them decimals

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money, she work for the money

And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday

Oh, stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday

Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper
Stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday

She works for the money, she work for the money

And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

Oh, gonna make you feel
You always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back, come back

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

[Chorus]
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

[Chorus]
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

[Outro]
You and me would stop this love drought

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way

Forward
Best foot first just in case
When we made our way 'til now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight
Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while
Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me
Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forward

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Oh nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became a remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Outro]
How I missed you, my love

Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin')
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me
I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag

I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow-bone it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Get what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay)
I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay
Prove to me you got some coordination, cause I slay
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay
When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, cause I slay
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, cause I slay
I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making
