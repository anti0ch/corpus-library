Christmas lights out in the yard 
A wreath hung our door 
There was Christmas music on the radio 
And I stare outside my window 
Waiting for Santa to come 
I couldn't wait to see under our tree when 
Santa's work was done 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Everybody all over the world tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
All year long I tried to be 
As good as I could be 
Just a boy with all the childhood dreams 
And I sit down and write, 
"Dear Santa, don't forget to come my way. 
I'll see you soon and please make room 
for my guitar in your sleigh" 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Everybody all over the world tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
People all sharin' their hearts tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmas all over the world 
Have a happy Christmas 
And make a joyful noise 
Have a happy Christmas 
From all us wild-eyed boys 
I never got that pony 
But they taught me to believe 
That what means the most is only 
To give more than receive 
And if we could wish together 
I'd wish the world in harmony 
'Cause if Christmas could last forever 
What better world it'd be 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Everybody all over the world tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Everybody all over the world tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
Everybody all over the world 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
People all sharin' their hearts tonight 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
Singing Hallelujah it's Christmas 
It's Christmastime again 
Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, what it means to me
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
I feel like runnin' wild
As anxious as a little child
To bring you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
(Happiness in this comin' year)
Deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Dress the trees with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight
All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, what you mean to me...
On this Christmas Christmas Christmas day...
I love you, Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas day...
What you mean to me... [fade] 
I feel the joy in this Christmas time
But something's missing in this heart of mine
The Choirs sings that the season's here
I always miss you this time of year
It's crowded out in Trafalgar square 
But it feels so empty when you're not there
They're all waiting for snow to fall 
But I'm still waiting for a miracle
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
If New Year comes and my gifts still there
The lights come down and the tree is bare
I'll keep it wrapped til December then
I'll place it under the tree again
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
Christmas morning finally 
I run downstairs excitedly
Then to my surprise I see
The greatest gift in front of me
You left your heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas 
You left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time 
It's that time of year when the whole world is heart to heart
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces
Christmas is love
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Chirstmas is love, hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love
We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces
Christmas is love
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love... Christmas is love... Christmas is love... Love... 
The city's full of manger scenes
And stores lit up in red and green.
But down the road just out of town
There's more magic to be found.
The countryside is all a-glow
With holly trees and mistletoe.
And in them woods there lives a bear
Known to all as Thistlehair.
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair
He comes around this time of year
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer.
The kids all love this shiny coat
And the smell of honey on his nose.
He tells them all about that star
And everything that it stands for.
The birthday we all celebrate
Is still our favorite holiday
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair
Wherever you find old Thistlebear
There'll be music in the air.
He dances 'round the Christmas tree
Every single New Year's eve.
Then he and all his furry friends
Gather 'Round the fire again
Singin' 'Bout those Angels' wings
Gifts of love that Christmas brings.
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Every little boy and girl
Out there, love Thistlehair
Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.
About Christmas time and what it means
To all the children of the world.
Thistlehair the Christmas bear
Spreadin' the good news everywhere... 
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people
Both near and afar
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season where ever you are
On the small country roads
Lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas, Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds 
In the eyes of young babies 
Their first fallen snow
The elderly's memories that never grow old
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas, Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing
And the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means 
And what we believe
From the sandy white beaches
Where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas, Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhere 
I am very rich.
I'm rich in friends.
I'm rich in family.
I'm rich in loved ones.
And, because of all these lovely things in my life.
It doesn't matter what time of year it is.
'Cause the truth is...
Everyday is Christmas.
The presents have all been open.
And Santa's done with his sleigh.
The tree's out in the garbage.
It's about to get hauled away.
We gotta go back to school, now.
The neighbours took down their lights.
It doesn't matter if it's cold out.
'Cause we're gonna be all right.
Christmas...
When it's Halloween.
Christmas...
When it's New Years Eve.

Christmas...
It's a holiday.
Everyday, everyday is Christmas.
The fireworks we've been feeling.
Are hotter, than the Fourth of July.
From Summer time to Winter.
I know, you'll still be mine.
We don't need no reindeer.
We don't need candy canes.
'Cause anytime you're with me.
That's my favourite day.

How can I celebrate when I'm not with you
Snow is falling, falling to the ground
I can't smile, I can't sleep
'Cause you're not around
This Christmas make my wish come true
I'm waiting patiently
Santa if you're listneing
Bring my baby back to me
'Cause he's on the call of duty
Serving our country
He's making it a better place
For all of us to be
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
I'll see you soon
There's no Christmas without you
It's Christmas day,
Get your gifts under the tree
'Cause all the bags and fancy shoes
Don't mean a thing to me
The only thing I really want
Is to have you home safely
So baby, baby
Why don't you come home to me
Christmas time
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you
You know I love you
There's no Christmas without you

Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
And a feeling that will last all through the year
On the corner carolers are singing
There's a touch of magic in the air
From grown up to minor no one could be finer
Times are hard but no one seems to care
Christmas Eve and all the world is watching
Santa guides his reindeer through the dark
From rooftop to chimney, from Harlem to Bimini
They will find a way into your heart
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
And a feeling that will last all through the year
Just outside the window snow is falling
But here beside the fire we share the glow
Of moonlight and brandy, sweet talk and candy
Sentiments that everyone should know
Memories of the year that lays behind us
Wishes for the year that's yet to come
And it stands to reason that good friends in season
Make you feel that life has just begun
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"
And a feeling that will last all through the year
So when spirits grow lighter
And hopes are shinin' brighter
Then you know that Christmas time is here
It's Christmas time
It's Tis the time
It's Christmas time
It's Christmas time
It's Tis the time
It's Christmas time
It's Christmas time
It's Tis the time
It's Christmas time
It's Christmas time
It's Tis the time
It's Christmas time

And wonder who'll like it and wonder what to do
With the rest of tonight and tomorrow night too

I don't want to feel lonely but I'm here alone
And the snow falls down, coming down

Come on weatherman
Give us a forecast snowy white
Can't you hear the prayers
Of every childlike heart tonight
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'
Somebody said it's four feet deep
But it doesn't matter
Give me the laughter
I'm gonna choose to keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas
The only Christmas for me
Where the love circles around us
Like the gifts around our tree
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado
Than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me
Every now and then
I get a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California, maybe tinsel town's for me
There's a parade there
We'd have it made there
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting
Still I think I'm gonna keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas
The only Christmas for me
Where the love circles around us
Like the gifts around our tree
Well they say in L.A.
It's a warm holiday
It's the only place to be
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado
Than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me
A tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me

It's Christmas Eve, and no snow's falling down
I'm all alone, and there's no one around
Can't pay my bills 'cause I lost my job
I still got power but my internet's off
I hate this world, but I love this new seed
68954012663
I spawn in a forest with snow on the floor
Could this be the Christmas I was searching for?
My mates went away, and they didn't invite me
My parents aren't dead, no they just don't like me
Put two blocks of snow and a pumpkin together
I made a friend who'll be with me forever
'Cause it's a Minecraft Christmas time
Chilling with my buddy even though I'm offline
There's a whole world of joy and cheer
That's a very very very nice Christmas you're having this year
We built a house, well, it's more of a shack
I got the wood and he's got my back
He throws his balls at the mobs so unruly
I decked the halls with this lapis lazuli
We ventured out, just my snowman and me
We found a sapling for a Christmas tree (Christmas tree)
We skipped back home, so happy and gay
No, wait! I meant that in the old-fashioned way!
We had a roast chicken, 'cause the game's not got turkey
We made mashed potato from this squid that's so derpy
But the furnace was hot, and when I awoke I found
Fifteen little snowballs lying there on the ground
'Cause it's a Minecraft Christmas time
Nothing seems cheery now my buddy has died
There's a whole world of pain and fear
It's a very very very bad Christmas I'm having this year
There goes my phone, it's a text from my dad (Merry Christmas, son)
An early gift; he got my internet back
Hop on the server, all my friends are online
Turns out they've been waiting for me all of this time
Spawn into the world, and what do I see?
A snowman party for my homies and me
Exchanging gifts and dancing without a care
Me and my snowman, we're walking in the air
It's a Minecraft Christmas time
Chilling with my buddies, everyone is online
There's a whole world of joy and cheer
That's a very very very nice Christmas-
'Cause it's a Minecraft Christmastime
Chilling with my buddies everyone is online
There's a whole world of joy and cheer
That's a very very very nice Christmas you're having-
A very very very nice Christmas (woo-aoh)
A very very very nice Christmas we're having this year
It would be a shame if something were to happen to it 
I don't wanna be
(Wanna be) alone babe.
Unless I'm alone (unless I'm alone) Unless I'm alone babe.
'Cause it won't be (won't be) cause it won't be.
Hold you close babe, hold you close the way that I used to.
'Cause it won't be, no it won't be. 'Cause it won't...
There's people on the sidewalk, music in the air.
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here.
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do.
'Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you.
I don't wanna spend this time without you.
I just wanna hold you close to me, kiss beside the Christmas tree.
Baby say you'll be coming home.
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)

The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be, it won't be.
Unless I'm alone with you
Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms.
Keep from the cold, you'll be safe and warm.
We're classic love together, the love that never dies.
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes.
It's the weather time to be together.
There's no sadder time to be alone, hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It's won't be Christmas.
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be, it won't be.
Unless I'm alone with you
I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me, kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby say you'll be coming home
Coming home
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It's won't be Christmas.
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be, it won't be.

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (a mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
(It's the rascals)
Last Christmas

I'm waking up early this morning,
I can't wait to see our christmas tree,
There's a big blanket of snow,
Covering each and every home.

Frost grows outside the window
First kiss under the mistletoe
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Bells chime inside a steeple
Open the doors see the people sing
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
I've been checking my list twice
Got plans to give you your gift tonight
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Wake up under a lit tree
One wish came true you're here with me
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Yeah
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again

La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!

La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again! 
It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard but while you’re having fun
There’s a world outside your window and it’s a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you
Where there’s death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight we’re reaching out and touching you
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there’s no hope tonight
Why is comfort to be feared, why is to touch to be scared?
How can they know it’s Christmas time at all?
Here’s to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here’s to them
And all there is to come
Can they know it’s Christmas time at all?
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
Heal the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again 
Christmas time, don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay
('Cause) last Christmas
(I was) driving home for Christmas
(And) All I want for Christmas is
(To) Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
Oh, won't you stay another day
('Cause) last Christmas
(I was) driving home for Christmas
(And) All I want for Christmas is
(To) Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)
Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously, he loves you
We can make a Mr. Hanky too
(Won't you) fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
(Oh night that leads to morn, leads to morn)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
Oh, won't you stay another day 
I can't quite understand
The feeling that fills this land
Everyone knows, both young and old
To the season to lend a hand
December, the time it's called
Noticed them most of all
I don't know why, the Fourth of July
Waiting for snow to fall
Yes it's Christmas
My favorite time of year
All of the joy you dreamed
Love in the atmosphere, atmosphere
Yes it's Christmas
My favorite songs to sing
Birth of a newborn King
Welcome the peace He brings
Parents without a sign
No children have on their minds
A time to think twice
Have I been nice
Or a mum leave the past behind
Romance now fills the air
A good time has been prepared
I can hardly wait, what's coming looks great
For the joy and the laughs we share
Yes it's Christmas
My favorite time of year
All of the joy you dreamed
Love in the atmosphere, oh, atmosphere
Yes it's Christmas
My favorite songs to sing
Birth of a newborn King
Welcome the peace He brings
Oh, Merry Christmas
From me to you
Merry Christmas
May all your dreams come true
Merry Christmas to all
To all, this year
Merry Christmas
Merry Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
From my heart to yours
Merry Christmas to all, this year
Yes it's Christmas
Oh, yes it's Christmas
My favorite time of year
All of the joy you dreamed
Love in the atmosphere, oh, the atmosphere
Yes it's Christmas
My favorite songs to sing
Birth of a newborn King
Welcome the peace He brings
Merry Christmas to all, this year
Merry Christmas 
Its Christmas time
Its Christmas time
Peace on earth, this starry night.
I will sing my gift to you,
A Christmas lullaby.
I hold you close to me
Under twinkling lights.
Rock you softly as
The day turns into night.
The angels are listening...
Its Christmas time
Its Christmas time
Peace on earth, this starry night.
I will sing my gift to you,
A Christmas lullaby.
The wind blows gently
Whispering your name.
Somewhere bells are ringing,
It seems so far away.
The angels are listening...
Its Christmas time
Its Christmas time
Peace on earth, this starry night.
I will sing my gift to you,
A Christmas lullaby.
I hold you close to me
Near the candlelight.
You are sleeping
In my arms tonight.
Its Christmas time
Its Christmas time
Peace on earth, this starry night.
I will sing my gift to you,
A Christmas lullaby.
Its Christmas time
Its Christmas time
Peace on earth, this starry night.
I will sing my gift to you,
A Christmas lullaby.
A Christmas lullaby.
A Christmas lullaby. 
Snowman Angels Ribbon’s bow’s 
Dreams of coco and missal tow
Seems like years since I’ve been home
Cant bare to spend another Christmas alone
Packed my bags I’m on my way 
Heading home for the holidays 
Crowded airports flights delayed should’ve hitched a ride on Santa’s sleigh
Cant wait to see their faces told ’em I couldn’t make it 
But I’m gonna be there soon
Twinkle lights and caroling candy cane shaped sugar cookies
I’m coming home for Christmas 
I’m coming home for Christmas
Friends and family trim the tree don’t put the star on top without me
Cause I’m coming home for Christmas 
I’m coming home its Christmas time
Bundled up like an Eskimo sitting in the snow
This little town is all the glow while Jingle Bells is on the radio
Just a block away from memory lane
Snowflakes frosting window’s 
Neighbors waving happy holiday’s while I slip and slide 
Up the icy walkway 
Cant wait to see their faces ring the bell my heart is racing 
Don’t even know their gonna see me soon 
Standing in the doorway 
Twinkle lights and caroling candy cane shaped sugar cookies
I’m coming home for Christmas 
I’m coming home for Christmas
Friends and family trim the tree don’t put the star on top without me
Cause I’m coming home for Christmas 
I’m coming home its Christmas time
Yeah, Yeah
The door swings open Merry Christmas
They cover me with hugs and kisses
The little ones say a Christmas wish came true and mine did too
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I’m finally home for Christmas
Friends and family trim the tree lets put the star on and hang the stockings 
I’m finally home for Christmas 
Cant believe I’m home for Christmas time
I’m finally home for Christmas time 
It was summer
I did love you true
Feelin' like a fool
Fall passed by
I though you'd fade away
But you left me with the pain
Winter calls for falling snow
You promised me you'd never go
And Christmas will be here
And Christmas will be here
It's the hope I'm clinging to
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
When I was still with you
December discovers
It was summer love
I wondered if you knew
Snow that freezes
Ocean breezes, blue
A place that we once knew
Winter calls for falling snow
You promised me you'd never go
And Christmas will be here
And Christmas will be here
It's the hope I'm clinging to
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
When I was still with you
Broken pieces
Grown on beaches by you
When you broke my heart in two
Winter calls for falling snow
You promised me you'd never go
And Christmas will be here
And Christmas will be here
It's the hope I'm clinging to
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
When I was still with you
This December
All I'll remember is you
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June 
I wait for Christmas all year long
How I wish I that I could only change it
Take the calendar and re-arrange it
Then every day would be so nice
Candy Canes and all the Snow that's fallin
Every summer would be Deck the Hallin
Every day at Christmas comes from me to you
So I pray...And I wait... And I hope that it doesn't come late.
Why couldn't it be Christmas everyday.
Riding around with Santa on his Sleigh
Don't you know if you'll be good just like you should
You'll here those jingle bell rings
Why couldn't it be Christmas everynight
So that it will meet those twinkling lights
When you say every days a holiday
You'll here those calendars sing
Why couldn't it be Christmas Christmas Christmas everyday
Just believe in Christmas Christmas Christmas all the way
And every time I see your eyes
Their some mistletoe that's right above you
Where the Christmas gifts do say I love you
There some that say it's just a dream
But close your eyes and you can almost see it
All you have to do is just believe it
Maybe there's a stocking full of Christmas Joy
So I pray... and I wait... and I hope that it doesn't come late
Why couldn't it be Christmas everyday
Riding around with Santa on his Sleigh
Don't you know if you'll be good just like you should
You'll here those jingle bell rings
Why couldn't it be Christmas Christmas Christmas everyday
Just believe in Christmas Christmas Christmas all the way
Whatever kind of weather
Summer, Spring and Fall will melt together
Now I can see it clear
That we can make it ... 
I don’t want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don’t care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
It’s YOU
I don’t want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don’t care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don’t need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won’t make me happy with a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yooou baby
I won’t ask for much this Christmas
I won’t even wish for snow
I’m just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won’t make a list and sent it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won’t even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer’s click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight
What more can I do??
All I want for Christmas is you
Yooou baby
Oh! All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly baby)
And the sound of children’s laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won’t you bring me the one I really need
Won’t you please bring my baby to me? oooh
I don’t want a lot for Christmas
This is all I’m asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
Yooou baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
You’re all I want
You’re all I need
Christmas day baby you and me
You’re all I want
You’re all I need
Christmas Day baby you and me 
Let's Go!
Big Time!

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know

And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

And may all your Christmases be white 
We wish you a Merry Christmas;

Outside the carolers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh god I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must've snaped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone.
Well I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
Causes a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package (hot damn)
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone.
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home 
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas

Full of hope to give, these times in which we live
Please no more lists, send no more gifts
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time
Is peace tonight, peace for all
That season's greetings last beyond a festive fall
Santa's home, his reindeer sleep
A child's strength is their belief

That belief that children have at Christmas time
The dying embers glow
We watch the falling snow
Lucky to be home when some are all alone

I might as well go ahead and tell you right up front: I believe in Santa Claus.
Now, you can believe or not believe, but I'm here to tell you for a fact that
there is a Santa Claus, and he does bring toys and stuff like that on Christmas
Eve night.
I know, I know. It sounds like I've had too much eggnog, don't it?
All I ask is that you wait till I get through telling my story before you make
up your mind.
When I was a kid, Christmas time had a magic to it that no other season of the
year had. There was just something in the air, something that you couldn't put
your finger on, but it was there, and it affected everybody.
It seemed like everybody smiled and laughed more at that time of year, even the
people who didn't hardly smile and laugh the rest of the year. "You reckon it's
gonna snow? I sure do wish it'd snow this year. Do you reckon it's gonna?" Heck
no, it won't gonna snow. As far as I know, it ain't never snowed in Wilmington,
North Carolina, at Christmas time in the whole history of man. It seemed like
everybody in the world had snow at Christmas except us.
In the funny papers, Nancy and Sluggo and Little Orphan Annie had snow to frolic
around in at Christmas time. The Christmas cards had snow. Bing Crosby even had
snow to sing about.
But not one flake fell on Wilmington, North Carolina. But that didn't dampen our
spirits one little bit.
Our family celebrated Christmas to the hilt. We were a big, close-knit family,
and we'd gather up at Grandma's house every year. My grandparents lived on a
farm in Bladen County, about fifty miles from Wilmington, and I just couldn't
wait to get up there. They lived in a great big old farmhouse, and every
Christmas they'd fill it up with their children and grandchildren. We'd always
stay from the night of the twenty-third through the morning of the twenty-sixth.
There'd be Uncle Clyde and Aunt Martha, Uncle Lacy and Aunt Selma, Uncle Leroy
and Aunt Mollie, Uncle Stewart and Aunt Opal, and my mama and daddy, Ernest and
Nadine. I won’t even go into how many children were there, but take my word for
it, there were a bunch.
There'd be people sleeping all over that big old house. We kids would sleep on
pallets on the floor, and we'd giggle and play till some of the grown-ups would
come and make us be quiet. All the usual ground rules about eating were off for
those days at Grandma's house. You could eat as much pie and cake and candy as
you could hold, and your mama wouldn't say a word to you. My grandma would cook
from sunup to sundown and love every minute of it. She'd have cakes, pies candy,
fruit and nuts setting out all the time, and on top of that, she'd cook three
big meals a day. I mean, we eat like pigs.
Christmas was also the only time that my Granddaddy would take a drink. It was a
Southern custom of the time not to drink in front of small children, so
Granddaddy kept his drinking whiskey hid in the barn. When he'd want to go out
there and get him a snort, he'd say that he had to go see if the mare had had
her foal yet. It was a good, good time. A little old-fashioned by some peoples
standards, but it suited us just fine.
If I'm not mistaken, it was the year I was five years old that my cousin Buford
told me that there wasn't any Santa Claus. Buford was about nine at the time. He
always was a mean-natured cuss.
Still is.
Well, I just refused to believe him. I said, "You're telling a great big fib,
Buford Ray, 'cause Santa Claus comes to see me every Christmas, right here at
Grandma and Granddaddy's house."
"That ain't Santa Claus. That's your mama and daddy."
One thing led to another and I got so upset about the prospect of no Santa Claus
that I went running into the house crying.
"Grandma, Grandma! Buford says there ain't no Santa Claus! There is a Santa
Claus, ain't they, Grandma?"
"Of course there is, Curtis. Buford was just joking with you."
Aunt Selma heard me talking to Grandma and walked to the door. "Buford Ray, get
yourself in this house right this minute!"
When he came in, Aunt Selma grabbed him by the ear, led him into the front room
and swatted him.
Granddaddy was also a big defender of Santa Claus. He would talk about Santa
Claus like he was a personal friend of his. And the more he went to check on the
mare, the more he talked about Santa Claus, or "Sandy Claws," as he called him.
"Yes, children, old Sandy Claws will be hitching up them reindeers and heading
on down this a-way before long. Wonder what he's gonna bring this year?"
He'd have us so excited by the time we went to bed that I reckon if visions of
sugarplums ever danced in anybody's heads, it was ours.
Christmas Eve night, after we had eaten about as much supper as we could hold,
we'd go in the front room. There'd always be a big log fire crackling in the
fireplace, and Granddaddy would always say the same thing.
"Children, do y'all know why we have Christmas every year?"
"Cause that's when the Baby Jesus was born."
"That's right. We're celebrating the Lord's birthday. Do y'all know where He was
born at?"
"In Bethlehem," we would all chime in.
"That's right, He was born in a stable in Bethlehem almost two thousand years
ago."
Then Granddaddy would put on his spectacles and read Saint Luke's version of the
Christmas story. Then, after we'd had family prayer, Granddaddy would always get
a twinkle in his eye. "I reckon I'd better step out to the barn and see if that
old mare has had her baby yet."
There was always a chorus of, "Can I go with you, Granddaddy?"
"Y'all had better stay in here by the fire. It's mighty cold outside. I'll be
right back."
When Granddaddy came back in the house, he'd always say, "I was on my way back
from the barn while ago, and I heard something that sounded like bells
a-tinkling, way back off yonder in the woods. I just can't figure why bells
would be ringing back in the woods this time of night."
"It's Santa Claus! It's Santa Claus!"
"Well, now, I never thought of that. I wonder if it was old Sandy Claws. You
children better get to bed. You know he won't come to see you as long as you're
awake."
Then it was time to say good night. All the grandchildren would go around
hugging all the grown-ups. "Good night Grandma, good night Granddaddy, good
night Uncle Clyde, good night Aunt Mollie," and so forth.
We would always try to stay awake, lying on our pallets until Santa Claus got
there, but we always lost the battle. It sounded like the Third World War at
Grandma's house on Christmas morning. There was cap pistols going off and baby
dolls crying, and all the children hollering at the top of their lungs.
By the time the next school year started, I was six years old and in the first
grade. I kept thinking about what Buford had said. I didn't want to believe it,
but it kept slipping into the back door of my mind.
At school, Buford was three grades ahead of me, but I'd still see him sometimes.
Every time he'd see me that whole year, he'd make it a point to rub it in about
Santa Claus.
He'd do something like get me around a bunch of his older buddies and say, "Hey,
you fellers, Curtis still believes in Santa Claus." And they'd all laugh and
point.
Away from any adult persuasion, I guess Buford finally wore me out. I returned
to Grandma's house the next year not believing that there was a Santa Claus.
Christmas lost a little of its mystique. Oh, I still enjoyed it. I even
pretended that I believed in "Sandy Claws" for Granddaddy's benefit, but it
wasn't the same.
Well, as you know, time marches on, children grow up and leave home, including
me.
I was living in Denver, Colorado, married, with a child, and I hadn't been home
for Christmas since our little daughter had been born. Dawn was three that year,
and this would be the first time that she really knew about Santa Claus, and she
was some kind of excited.
We had the best time shopping for her, buying all the little toys that she
wanted.
Daddy called me about three weeks before Christmas and said, "Son, you know that
your grandparents are getting old. They've requested that all the children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren come home the way we used to. Can you make
it, son?"
"We'll be there, Daddy."
I couldn't think of a better place in the whole world for little Dawn to spend
her first real Christmas, so we packed up and headed for North Carolina.
Grandma was eighty-two years old, but she still cooked all day long, and she
still enjoyed every minute of it.
Granddaddy was eighty-four, but he still had a twinkle in his eye and a mare in
the barn.
The old house was fuller than ever, with a whole new generation of children in
it. Even Buford. He had married, but he didn't have any children. He didn't want
any. One of my cousins said he figured Buford was too stingy to have children.
Buford was still the same, except that he had changed from a boy with a mean
nature to a full-grown man with a cynical nature and a know-it-all attitude.
Just before we went into the front room for family prayer and the reading of the
Christmas story, I overheard him say to somebody, "I don't know why Granddaddy
keeps filling the children's heads full of that Santa Claus nonsense. I think
it's ridiculous. If I had children, I wouldn't let him tell them all that junk."
I looked hard at Buford. I had never liked him, and I liked him even less now.
Our little daughter was so excited when Granddaddy started talking about "Sandy
Claws" that she jumped up and down and clapped her hands.
When I took her up to bed, there was pure excitement in those big brown eyes.
"Santa Claus is coming, Daddy! Santa Claus is coming, Daddy!"
I got a warm feeling all over, and I sure was glad to be back at Grandma's house
at Christmas time.
After all the children had gone to sleep, the grown-ups started going out to
their cars to get the toys they had brought for Santa Claus to leave under the
Christmas tree.
I decided to wait until everybody else had finished before I put Dawn's presents
out. This was a special time for me and I wanted to enjoy it.
After everybody had gone up to bed, I went to the car to get Dawn's toys. To my
shock, I couldn't find them. I ran back into the house to my wife. "Sylvia,
where did you pack Dawn's Christmas presents?"
"I thought you packed them."
I was close to panic, but I didn't want Sylvia to know it. I said, "Oh well, you
just go on to bed, honey, and I'll look again. I probably just overlooked them."
I kissed my wife goodnight and went back downstairs.
I knew I hadn't overlooked them. We had somehow forgot to pack them, and they
were two thousand miles away in Denver, Colorado.
I was a miserable man. I just didn't feel like I could face little Dawn the next
morning. She'd be so disappointed. All the other children would have the toys
that Santa had brought them, and my beloved little daughter wouldn't have
anything.
How could I have been so dumb? Here it was, twelve o'clock Christmas Eve night,
all the stores closed, everybody in bed, and me without a single present for
little Dawn. I was heartbroken.
I went into the front room and sat by the dying fire, dejected and hopeless.
I don't know how long I sat there staring at the embers, but sometime later on I
heard a rustle behind me and somebody said, "You got a match, son?"
I turned around and almost fell on the floor.
Standing not ten feet from me was a short, fat little man in a red suit, with a
long white beard and a pipe sticking out of his mouth.
I couldn't move, I couldn't speak. He looked at me and chuckled.
"Have you got a match, son? I ran out and I want to get this pipe going."
When I finally got my voice back, all I could say was, "Who are you?"
"Well, people call me by different names in different parts of the world, but
around here they call me Santa Claus."
"No, I mean who are you really?"
I just told you, son. How about that match?"
I stumbled to the mantelpiece, got a kitchen match and gave it to him.
"Much obliged." He stood there lighting his pipe, with me looking at him like he
was a ghost or something.
"How did you get in here?"
"Oh, I've got my ways."
"I thought you were supposed to slide down the chimney."
"That's a common misconception. Would you slide down a chimney with a fire at
the bottom?"
"Well, no. I mean, no, sir."
"Well, neither would I."
"How did you get here?"
"I've got a sturdy sleigh and the finest team of reindeer a man could have."
"But we ain't got snow."
Santa Claus laughed so hard that his considerable belly shook. "I don't need
snow. Half the places I go in the world don't have snow. Besides, I like to get
out of the snow once in a while. We have it year-round at the North Pole, you
know."
"You mean you really live at the North Pole?"
"Of course, I've always lived at the North Pole. Don't you know anything about
Santa Claus, son?"
"Well, yeah, but I thought it was all a big put-on for the children."
"That's the trouble with you grown-ups. You think that everything you can't see
is a put-on. It's a shame grown people can't be more like children. They don't
have any trouble believing in me."
"You mean you've really got a sleigh, with reindeer named Donner and Blitzen and
stuff like that?"
"That's right, son. There's Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen and Dasher
and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen. Of course, there's no Rudolph with the red
nose. I don't know who came up with that one. Rudolph really is a put-on."
"But what are you doing here? Why did you come?"
"Because there's a little girl in this house who believes in me very much. Now,
she'd be mighty disappointed to wake up Christmas morning and have nothing under
the tree."
"You mean you a came all the way here just because one little girl believes in
you?"
"That's right, son. There's magic in believing. Besides, she's not the only one
in this house who believes in me."
"Who else?"
"Why, your grandfather, of course."
"You mean Granddaddy wasn't putting us on all those years? He really believed in
you?"
"Of course he believed in me."
"Well, why do you do this?"
"It's my way of celebrating the most important birthday in the history of man.
Our Lord has given us so much. How can we do less?"
Santa Claus consulted a piece of paper he pulled out of his pocket and started
taking a doll and other toys out of a big bag he had brought with him.
"Well, I've got to go, son. I've got a lot of stops to make before sunup. It's
been really nice talking to you. Thanks for the match."
"Can I help you with your bag, Santa Claus?"
"No, that's all right, son. I'm used to carrying it."
I walked outside with him. "Where's your sleigh, Santa Claus?"
"It's parked right over there in the edge of the woods. You can come over and
see it if you like."
I started walking over to his sleigh with him, but then I had a thought.
"I'm gonna have to miss seeing your sleigh and reindeer. Thank you so very much.
You saved my life. God bless you, Santa Claus. I'll see you next year."
"God bless you, too, son and a Merry Christmas to you and yours."
Santa Claus started across the yard toward his sleigh, and I went running back
in the house like a wild man. I raced up the stairs.
"Buford, Buford, get up!"
"What's the matter, is the house on fire?"
"No, but hurry. Come out on the upstairs porch."
Buford grumbled as he got up and followed me out on the upstairs porch.
"What the heck do you want? It's cold out here."
"Just hush up and listen."
Well, we listened by a full minute and nothing happened.
"You're crazy. I'm going back to bed."
"Buford, if you go back in the house, you're gonna miss something that I want
you, above all people, to see."
We waited for a little while longer and I had almost given up when I heard it.
It was just a little tinkle at first, hanging on the frosty air and getting
louder by the second. It was sleigh bells!
Buford looked at me and said, "Curtis, is this some kind of joke or something?"
"No, Buford, I swear it ain't. Just wait a minute now!"
The sound of sleigh bells was getting louder and Buford's face was getting
whiter. "You got somebody out there doing that, ain't you? Admit it! You got
somebody out there, ain't you?"
I didn't say a word. All of a sudden it sounded like somebody had flushed a
covey of quail. That sleigh came up out of the woods and headed west, hovering
just above the treetops.
Buford was speechless. I thought he was gonna pass out. He held on to the
banister and took deep breaths. Even if you believe so far, I know you ain't
gonna believe this next part, but it really happened. Santa Claus made a big
circle and turned and flew right around he house. I bet he won't over twenty
feet from the upstairs porch when he passes by me and Buford.
Old Santa Claus could really handle them reindeer. Then he headed west again,
moving at a pretty good clip this time.
I hate to even tell you this next part, 'cause you'll think I took it right out
of the book, but I didn't. Anyway, just about the time he was getting out of our
hearing, he hollered, "Merry Christmas, everybody!"
And then he was gone.
"Curtis, do you know where Granddaddy keeps that bottle hid in the barn? I need
me a drink."
I don't believe that Buford ever told anybody about seeing Santa Claus.
I know I didn't, not until now. But I just had to tell somebody about it. It's
been hard keeping it to myself all these years.
I'm a granddaddy myself now. That little girl that caused all this to happen
with her faith in Santa Claus is grown and married and has a three-year-old girl
and a five-year-old boy.
Me and Sylvia moved back to North Carolina many years ago and bought a big old
farmhouse. Now my grandchildren come and spend Christmas with me and their
grandmother. There's not as many of us as there was at Grandma's house, but we
have just as big a time and celebrate Christmas just as hard.
In fact, Christmas is about the only time a year I'll take a drink. I always get
me a pint of Old Granddad at Christmas time. Since the grandchildren are so
small, I don't like to drink in front of them, so I keep my drinking whiskey hid
out in the barn.
When I want to go out there and get me a snort, I always tell the grandchildren
that I've got to see if the cows got corn. Of course, all the grown-ups know why
I'm going out to the barn, or at least they think they do.
I always make my last trip to the barn after I've read the Christmas story and
had family prayer. Everybody thinks I'm going out to get me a snort, but they're
wrong.
I'm just going out to hear the sleigh bells ring.

Oh, hey

Trying to catch that old St. Nick
Leaving presents under my tree
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed
Dreaming of a million sugarplums
Dancing in my head
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time
The spirit of giving is in our lives, oh
Oh, how much joy it brings to see the ones you love

I've heard about this baby boy
Who's come to earth to bring us joy
And I just want to sing this song to you
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
With every breath I'm singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
A couple came to Bethlehem
Expecting child, they searched the inn
To find a place for You were coming soon
There was no room for them to stay
So in a manger filled with hay
God's only Son was born, oh Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
The shepherds left their flocks by night
To see this baby wrapped in light
A host of angels led them all to You
It was just as the angels said
You'll find Him in a manger bed
Immanuel and Savior, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
A star shown bright up in the east
To Bethlehem, the wisemen three
Came many miles and journeyed long for You
And to the place at which You were
Their frankincense and gold and myrrh
They gave to You and cried out Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I know You came to rescue me
This baby boy would grow to be
A man and one day die for me and you
My sins would drive the nails in You
That rugged cross was my cross, too
Still every breath You drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
I love Christmas in the snow
But Christmas in the sand oh man
I tell you that's where it's at
Hawaiian tropic on my skin
Candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips
It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy
But I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand
I must have had too much to drink
Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green
I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run, so fast
They were gone in a dash
It could've been the sun, it could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy
I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he tried too soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand
Don't need your winter coat
Don't need you winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back
You'll see Santa in his bathing suit
Tryin' to catch a wave, but he'll try too soon
He'll laugh so hard that he can barely breathe
It's what he did to me
He said you look naughty, but I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand, whoa oh oh
Christmas in the sand
I love Christmas in the sand 
It's almost Christmas
Everyone is wishing for everything they always wanted
And a beautiful, shiny winter wonderland
It's too easy to get temped
Cinnamon cider, sparking diamonds
Presents too big for the tree
So much shopping, there's no time left
For my friends and my family
Maybe we worry too much about wishing
And not enough about giving
Cause some people have nothing at all
Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas
Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas
So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you
So let just spend some time together
And be grateful that we're safe and warm
That our homes are filled with songs and laughter
We gather by the fire making s'mores
It's caring and sharing
All of the good things
Not taking anything for grated
And we have
Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas
Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas
So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you
I remember Christmas day
We run outside and play
Easy snow, snow fight, snowman
Scenery in your eyes, holding grandpa in
I'm just asking for one day
Let's keep making memories
Can we stay whole together, please?
By the Christmas tree
Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
Cause this is Christmas
Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
Cause this is Christmas
So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you
Son here's my happy Christmas to you 
Merry christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
Merry christmas, baby

And feel like I wanna kiss you
Underneath the mistletoe

Merry christmas, baby 
Christmas night,
Another fight,
Tears we cried,
A flood
Got all kinds of poison in, of poison in my blood
I took my feet
To Oxford Street,
Trying to right a wrong
"Just walk away," those windows say, but I can't believe she's gone.
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they flow
And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
And like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I've always loved you, darling, and I always will
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on
Those Christmas lights light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on
Oowwwhhhohooooowohohohoooo
Oh Christmas lights light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on 
Merry Christmas Baby
Merry Christmas baby
Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Bought me diamond rings for Christmas
I feel like I'm in paradise
Be at my side
I got music on my radio
Feel my vibe
I got music on my radio
I feel like I'm going to kiss you underneath the Mistletoe
Santa's coming down the chimney, half past three
All those pretty presents for my baby and for me
Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Treat me so nice
Bought me pretty presents
I feel like I'm in paradise
Merry Christmas girl

Merry Christmas Emily 
Merry Christmas Emily 
Emily was twenty three 
Sitting on the ground 
Under a dead palm tree 
6th and Speedway 
On Christmas day 
Seemed like things were gonna go my way 
But we had some good times 
Drinking cheap wine and popping pills 
Spending the holidays 
Getting drunk at the rusty nail 
Emily from a good family 
They fucked your head
And sent you to me 
'It's a Wonderful Life' 
Is playing on TV 
I still think about you 
Do you think about me 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
I still think about you do you still thing about me 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
Merry Christmas Emily 
It may have seemed 
like i was down and out 
But my insurance claim 
Was still paying out 
You were heading back up 
While I was going down 
So I reformed the band 
To try to keep you around 
Then we had some bad times 
Drinking wine in the summer heat 
A couple loud arguments 
Standing in the middle of Congress St. 
So there's Emily 
Under the dead palm tree 
Its Christmas day 
And its like 80 degrees 
I still think about you 
Do you still think about me 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
I still think about you 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
(Merry Christmas Emily) 
Merry Christmas Emily 
(Merry Christmas Emily)

(Merry Christmas Emily) 
I don't need a Christmas tree
All I need is you with me
Don't care about any gifts
Wrapped in a big red bow
I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you
I don't need a lot this Christmas
There is just one thing I want
Don't care about any gifts
Wrapped in a big red bow
I don't need the new cell-phone
Stacked over the fireplace
Santa Claus can make me jolly
With a ring on Christmas day
I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you
Oh you, oh you, you, baby
I don't need a lot this Christmas
I won't even ask for snow
I'll be right here just waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't write a letter and send it
To the Jolly Old Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magical reindeers click
'Cause I just want you here with me
Loving you could ever see
I really miss you
All I need this Christmas is you
Oh you, oh you, you, baby
Christmas lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of carolers
People stop and stare
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you please bring the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Santa, won't you bring him to me?
I need a lot this Christmas
You're all I'm asking for
I just want to see you smile
Next time I walk through that door
I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you
You, you this Christmas
You, baby
You, you this Christmas
You, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby

Watching the snow fall by the moonlight.
Got you wrapped up in my arms, girl it's so right.
(Mm) No place I'd rather be on this night.
Girl I got my private party all over your body, now.
This Christmas, something, let something, I'm feeling something different I want
to try.
Like me & you -
Kissing each other, under covers, candlelight (Yeah)
Looking at the tree, there's so much there.
But I wish I could wrap you up and put you under there.
Cause that's all I want is you, that's all I want is you.
That's all I need is you, that's all I need is you.
This Christmas is all about the little things.
(Christmas) So I'll put you before everything.
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas (Christmas)
It's Christmas and it'll never be the same again.
(Christmas) Girl it's something about this -
Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas.
(Christmas, with you)
Let me be the first to say it's been rough
We're always breaking up then we're right back together.
Everything you did I took for granted.
You couldn't stand it, now we're making it together.
Picture us hugging and kissing under the mistle toe (Toe, toe, toe)
I'ma eat you up like the cookies that get left for Santa Claus (Oh)
Looking at the tree, there's so much there.
But I wish I could wrap you up and put you under there.
Cause that's all I want is you, that's all I want is you.
That's all I need is you, that's all I need is you.
This Christmas is all about the little things.
(Christmas) So I'll put you above everything.
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas (Christmas)
It's Christmas and it'll never be the same again.
(Christmas) Girl it's something about this -
Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas.
(Christmas, with you)
If I could wish upon a star tonight.
I wish you'd be in my life forever.
Baby nothing's ever felt so right.
This Christmas, lets cherish the time together.
Baby all that really matters to me is right here, right now.
Finally figured it out.
(You-ooh) The greatest gift of heaven is you.
This Christmas is all about the special things.
(Christmas) So I'll put you before everything.
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas (Christmas)
It's Christmas and it'll never be the same again.
(Christmas) Girl it's something about this -
Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas.
(Christmas, with you)
Jingle bell, jingle bell.
Girl I'm here to say.
Jingle bell, jingle bell.
It's Christmas everyday.

It's beautiful outside and the wind is whistling
I look outside my window as I see my neighbor's Christmas tree
The snow is falling, my spirit's feeling happy
I'm feeling even better cause I got my family next to me
I gotta thank my Lord, thank you Lord
Thanks for what I have, thanks for what I got
I couldn't ask for more, wouldn't ask for more
God I am so glad, Thanks for what I got
Some think I am blessed just because of the
Amount written on my check not because of the
Amount of my happiness is the reason
Why I am so blessed
Having me a Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad
And having me a Merry Kwanzaa
Happy Hanukkah

With Donner, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Cupid, Rudolph, Comet
He's bringing goodies, to the ghettos and the hoodies
To mansions and suburban places and apartment kiddies
Representing Houston, Texas
ATL, Illinois ladies
Chilling with Rosie O'Donnell
Having a good time we clowning
Some think I am blessed just because of the
Amount written on my check not because of the
Amount of my happiness is the reason
Why I am so blessed
Having me a Merry Christmas

Snowflakes filling the air
People rushing past every display
No time for napping
There's buying and then wrapping
The gifts to be given away
Sparkling lights

Christmas trees loaded with joy
Hearts full of giving
Children are living
For what could be their favorite toy
Christmas is here

It's a wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here

It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year
Families together

Marked with laughter and cheer
And day long awaited
And much celebrated
Christmas is finally here
Christmas is here
It's a wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here

Oh, hey, y'all. Anybody else takin' note of what's goin' on on my favorite
holiday? 
Christmas has been bastardized 
Mass-marketed, commercialized, 
Overly-politicized 
They're puttin' a funk on Christmas. 
What happened to the simple bliss 
That's gotten lost in all of this? 
Guess I'll give my girl a kiss 
And try to get some this Christmas. 
Love, 
Peace, joy, 
Beautiful Christmas. 
Funkin' it up on Christmas. 
Love, (oh yeah!)

And, most of all, my wife's big rear! 
I'm gettin' me some this Christmas. 
Let's get unwrappin' presents done, 
Slip away from everyone, 
Close the door and have some fun. 
You ain't gettin' none this Christmas.

Oh, yeah, we'll see. 
Peace, joy, 
Maybe I planned ahead. 
Beautiful Christmas. 
Funkin' it up on Christmas.

To unlock that sweet booty.

설렘에 부풀어 눈을 뜨는 아침
선물의 리본끈을 풀어보는 느낌
너를 알아가는 날이면 날마다
거리를 장식한 반짝이는 불빛
그 중에 단연 네 눈에 뜨는 별빛
내 품 안에 녹을 듯이 너는 안겨와
혹시 내 잠결에
다가와있진 않을까
하며 All night 밤새 All night
하얗게 지새 맞이한걸
Just like the Christmas day
손꼽아 기다리던
Just like the Christmas day
Oh! 널 생각하면
그때 그 시절 어린애처럼
마냥 들뜨곤 해
You're just like Christmas day
길고도 차가운 계절 속에 오직
너만이 코트 속에 남아있는 온기
따뜻한 기억들 만으로 채워지고
(너무나도 따뜻한)
메마른 하늘에서 내린 하얀 기적
이뤄지긴 너무 힘들 것만 같던
꿈 속에도 간절했었던 그 기도.. 음.. Yeah
눈을 뜬 아침에
창문을 덮은 눈처럼
너는 All night 밤새 All night
조용히 쌓여 와있는걸
Just like the Christmas day
손꼽아 기다리던
Just like the Christmas day
Oh! 널 생각하면
그때 그 시절 어린애처럼
마냥 들뜨곤 해
You're just like Christmas day

Just like the Christmas day
Oh! 널 생각하면
그때 그 시절 어린애처럼

You're just like Christmas day
You're just like Christmas day
The morning I opened my eyes in heart fluttering excitement
It's like the feeling of untying the ribbon of a present
Every single day of getting to know you
The twinkling lights that decorate the streets
Among those, your eyes are especially like the star light
As if you're melting in my arms, you come into my embrace
What if you come to me
When I'm sleeping?
So I stay up all night, all night
In a white daze
Just like the Christmas day
That I've always waited for
Just like the Christmas day
Oh! When I think about you
I get excited like a kid just like those days,
Just like that time
You're just like Christmas day
In the long and cold season
Only you are the warmth that remains inside my coat
I'm getting filled with only warm memories
(So warm)
The white miracle that falls from the once dry sky
It seemed like it wouldn't come true
The prayer that I was so desperate for even in my dreams
When I opened my eyes in the morning,
Like the snow outside the window
You silently fell all night,
All night
Just like the Christmas day
That I've always waited for
Just like the Christmas day
Oh! When I think about you
I get excited like a kid just like those days,
Just like that time
You're just like Christmas day
Just like the Christmas day
That I've always waited for
Just like the Christmas day
Oh! When I think about you
I get excited like a kid just like those days,
Just like that time
You're just like Christmas day
You're just like Christmas day 
Where are you Christmas 
Why can't I find you 
Why have you gone away 
Where is the laughter 
You used to bring me 
Why can't I hear music play 
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too
Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time
I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love
Where are you Christmas
Fill your heart with love 
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one that I
Really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
Christmas is music and family in town
Christmas is Snoopy and Charlie brown
It's anticipating that snow's gonna fall
And praying for someplace to park at the mall
It's mom going crazy cause the turkey got burned
It's saying thanks for some gift you'll return
Christmas is caroling kids at your door
It's paper and ribbon all over the floor
Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I've been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here
Christmas is rooftops covered in lights
It's away in a manger, it's a wonderful life
Christmas is caring for those who got nothing
It's dropping your change in the bell ringer's bucket
Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I've been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here
Christmas is all of these fun things for sure
But, Christmas is really, oh so much more
It's good news of hope for the whole world because
Christmas is Jesus!
Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I've been counting down the days
I've been counting down the days
I've been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here 
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I,
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I,
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best.
It's time for the hollys of fun, and the folly or all of that jolly jazz,
The people are glowing, the sand is now howing, each window is showing it has
All the latest in choicing, the daddy invoicing and all that razzle that does,
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for New Year's Day,
Thanksgiving, Holloween and the rest. Christmas we love you the best.
I wouldn't trade, no, no. never would I, wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you
the best.
The traffic gets poky, the turkey gets smoky, and all of that holy stuff,
The people are shopping for things they'll be swapping like filigree boxes of
snuff,
Though you pour the hot toddy, to force everybody, though half of the toddy's
enough,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Father's Day or
Mother's,
Valentine, and the rest, Christmas we love you the best.
The jingle fell jingle you feel the old tingle, you buy the first single scene.
The idea is clever but subways will never quite handle that huge evergreen.
And the old office party, with Stanley and Molly keep drinking until they turn
green.
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Labor Day, or
Easter, Washington and the
rest, Christmas we love you the best. 
Steal this night away
So that we're not waiting
The feeling in my gut
Makes my head ache
And the feeling that I get
Walking downstairs
The feelings of surprise
Before my eyes
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
On this christmas day
On this christmas day
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's on this christmas day
And the gifts that we all gave
In remembrance
Of this final day
To ease this miracle
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
On this christmas day
On this christmas day
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
On this christmas day
On this christmas day
The snow is falling down
Around us now
The snow is falling down
Around around
The snow is falling down
The snow is falling down
The snow is falling down
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's on this christmas day
And It's on this christmas day
It's a miracle, yeah
It's a miracle
It's on this christmas day
oh on this christmas day
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
On this christmas day
Oh on this christmas day

It's a miracle
It's On this christmas day

꿈을 꾼 것 같아 찰나 스쳐 지난 시간
어느새 하얗게 새 옷을 입은 밤
따스히 피어난 모닥불 아래 모여 앉아
행복했던 추억 상자를 열어봐
이 기쁨의 눈물이 빛이 되고
저 밤하늘 별처럼 비추죠
모두 Merry Christmas
다시 아름다운 이 계절
예쁜 순간들로 기쁜 얘기들로
서로를 다 채워
모두 Merry Christmas
지난 1년 동안 늘 반짝인 나날들
온 세상을 하나 둘씩 비춰
따뜻한 오늘 밤 (오늘 밤)
마주한 눈빛은 항상 포근하게 빛나
마치 지난날을 감싸 안아주듯
난 눈 감고 손 모아 기도하죠
저 내일도 행복만 가득히
모두 Merry Christmas
다시 아름다운 이 계절
예쁜 순간들로 기쁜 얘기들로
서로를 다 채워
모두 Merry Christmas
지난 1년 동안 늘 반짝인 나날들
온 세상을 하나 둘씩 비춰
따뜻한 오늘 밤
눈이 덮어도 얼어붙어도
햇살은 언제나 있는 걸
빛이 돼줄게 모두 녹여줄게
두 눈 감아봐 맘껏 그려봐
보다 더 행복한 New Year
온 몸 감싸는 낯선 설렘에
모든 게 선물인 걸
모두 Merry Christmas
하얀 천사 같은 12월
함께 걸어 온 길 눈에
덮어 놓고 새롭게 시작해
모두 Merry Christmas
지난 1년 동안 늘 반짝인 나날들
온 세상을 하나 둘씩 비춰
따뜻한 오늘 밤
오늘 밤 오늘 밤
I feel like I was dreaming, this time that has passed quickly
The night has suddenly put on new white clothes
Sit gathered under the warmly lit bonfire
Open a box of happy memories
This happiness becomes the light of tears
It shines like the stars in the night sky
Everyone Merry Christmas
This season is beautiful again
Fill each other with beautiful moments
And happy stories
Everyone Merry Christmas
The always sparkling days of the past 1 year
It lights the world one by one
Warm tonight (tonight)
Gaze that meet always shine cozily
As if it's embracing the past days
I close my eyes, gather my hands and pray
For tomorrow to be full of happiness
Everyone Merry Christmas
This season is beautiful again
Fill each other with beautiful moments
And happy stories
Everyone Merry Christmas
The always sparkling days of the past 1 year
It lights the world one by one
Warm tonight (tonight)
Even if it's covered and frozen with snow
There's always sunshine
I'll be the light and melt everything
Close your two eyes, draw it in your heart
Even happier New Year
The unfamiliar excitement embraces your body
Everything is a gift
Everyone Merry Christmas
White angel-like December
Cover the path we've walked together
In snow and start anew
Everyone Merry Christmas
The always sparkling days of the past 1 year
It lights the world one by one
Warm tonight
Tonight, tonight 
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All I want for Christmas is you...
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There up on the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby
Oh yeah, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas...is...you... (You, baby)
You... (All I want for Christmas is you)
Ohh, ohh... (All I want for Christmas is you, baby...)
Ooh, ooh... (All I want for Christmas is you, baby...)
(All I want for Christmas is you)
All I want for Christmas is you 
"Bah, humbug!" but that's too strong,
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from
Last year, ski shop,
Encounter, most interesting.
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,
I just need to catch my breath,
Christmas by myself this year.
Calendar picture, frozen landscape,
Chilled this room for twenty-four days,
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flashback to springtime, saw him again,
Would've been good to go for lunch,
Couldn't agree when we were both free,
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me,
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery,
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!
"I'm spending this one alone," he said.
"Need a break; this year's been crazy."
I said, "Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

It's Christmas in Hollywood
Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe
Let's fuck
It's Hanukkah in Inglewood
The dradles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah
Let's get drunk
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas
It's Christmas in Hollywood
Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe
Let's fuck
It's Hanukkah in Inglewood
The dradles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah
Let's get drunk
Just a little story about last Christmas
About some bad kids who were full of wishes
We gave some gifts, and we gave some loving
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin
Little Timmy stole from 7-11
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents
Zack got caught with a bottle of Jack
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack
So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!
It's Charlie Scene got egg-nog in my flask
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped
Like, "Oh, my God! Is that Saint Nick?"
Kids give me your lists like it's the 25th
Been accused of being a bad kid
But I get presents as is
Mrs. Clause just MySpace'd me
I blew off a date on Christmas Eve
So I don't give a fuck if you're naughty or nice
You might still get a Rolly and a gang of ice
So write your list and never have no fear
Have a Hollywood Christmas and an Undead new year!
Fuck, yeah!
Now watch the language, ho, ho, ho!
It's Christmas in Hollywood
Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe
Let's fuck
It's Hanukkah in Inglewood
The dradles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah
Let's get drunk
I'm about to serve it up for all you boys and girls
Good kids, bad kids, even Da Kurlzz
We were chilling at home and decking the halls
So I checked my phone and Santa had called
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve
He said that his jolly ass needed some help
He said Christmas ain't a day but a way of life
"If you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife!"
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle
Funnier than fuck you can ask Chris Kringle
So we all took flight but something was fishy
He asked for road ahead and started to kiss me
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildos
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster
It wasn't Saint Nick, it was a fucking impostor!
When we found out he started to pout
I took my bandanna and I choked him out
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest
I met a lot of Jeffs but this one was the shadiest
When it comes to cheer that motherfucker's a Grinch
So if you don't like Christmas, fuck you, bitch!
You kids are in big trouble. Oh, boy, ho, ho
It's Christmas in Hollywood
Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe
Let's fuck
It's Hanukkah in Inglewood
The dradles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Ho, ho, hey. Looks like Santa had a little too much Mada Shavensen eggnog
Let's get drunk
Hey, Hollywood Undead
Let's get drunk
You're pretty naughty this year
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
I ain't visiting you, faggots, so
Let's get drunk
It's Christmas in Hollywood
Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe let's fuck
It's Hanukkah in Inglewood
The dradles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah let's get drunk

Everybody waits for Christmas
For me it's New Year's Day
That's gonna come and take my blues away
I'm wishing on the stars for Christmas
And hoping for a better day
When it doesn't hurt to feel this way
And everywhere there's joy around this festive time of year
And happiness has never felt so far away
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for Christmas
Is New Year's Day
It's only seven days till Christmas
Six more till New Year's Day
It's not a good time to feel this way
Everywhere the snow surround you
And melt your troubles away
I can only hope to feel the same
I know there'll be tidings joy of this time next year
But happiness has never felt so far away
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for Christmas
Is New Year's Day
I remember how I used to feel at Christmas
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for Christmas
Is New Year's Day
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for Christmas
Is New Year's Day 
I don't want a lot for Christmas

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas baby is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents

With a toy on Christmas day

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Than just presents from a store
Why don't you give love on Christmas day
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas day
No greater gift is there than love
People you don't know
Smile and nod hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once of year
When the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say
Why don't you give love on Christmas day?
Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares
Give love on Christmas day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love

I see the lights are shining
Against the winter sky
Above the rooftops
Reindeer are flying
Bells are ringing through the night
I look outside
There's a sleigh ride
A choir begins to sing
Stars gleaming
Kids are dreaming
Of what the day will bring
In the fallen snow under the mistletoe
I need you here with me when I hold you close
Baby, take my hand in wonderland
Cause its Merry Christmas time again
Its Christmas time again
A wreath on every front door
Lights hung for all to see
Warm cider by the fire
Stockings for you and me
Kids a gift for Santa
Milk and cookies by the tree
I'm wondering what will he bring
This year on Christmas Eve
In the fallen snow under the mistletoe
I need you here with me when I hold you close
Baby, take my hand in wonderland
Cause its Merry Christmas time again
Well there's nothing like being home for Christmas
Its a wonderful time of year
And there's just one thing that's noticed missing
Baby I'd feel that something's missing
If you're not here
I see your eyes are shining
Just like the morning sky
One thing there's no denying
Loves gift of you and I
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas)
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas)
It's Christmas (It's Christmas time again)
Merry Christmas (It's Christmas time again)
Oh yeah (It's Christmas time again) 
Oh yeah...
Candles burning low,
Lot's of mistletoe.
Lot's of snow and ice,
Everywhere we go.
Choirs singing carols,
Right outside my door.
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah
I feel like running wild (running wild)
As reaches and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And happiness, happiness in the coming year
Oh yeah
Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing a silent night
Fill a sheet with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Hey yeah!
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
Yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Oh yeah
Merry Christmas, yeah
Oh yes! 
In this New York weather, I picture us together
Down the street as snow's falling, like I do for you, my darling 
The lights on the tree, it's not enough for me 
And forget the presents cause you're the only gift that I need 
This Christmas I just want you
This Christmas make it come true 
This Christmas won't be Christmas 
Till you're in my arms 
I stare out the window and hope that you're almost home
I've made turkey dinner and apple pie
Yes, I remembered
Santa this is my wish, just bring me him 
My heart keeps on breaking 
Every minute that I'm waiting 
This Christmas I just want you
This Christmas make it come true 
This Christmas won't be Christmas 
Till you come home 
This Christmas don't make me wait
This Christmas need you to stay
This Christmas won't be Christmas 
Till you're in my arms 
Bring me my baby, bring me my man
Harness the reindeer as fast as you can 
This Christmas I just want you
(I just want you)
This Christmas make it come true
(Make it come true) 
This Christmas won't be Christmas
Till you come home
(Come back home)
This Christmas don't make me wait
(Don't make me wait)
This Christmas need you to stay
(Need you to stay) 
This Christmas won't be Christmas 
Till you're in my arms 
Don't make me wait, need you to stay
Till you're coming home, baby

This is Christmas season so there isn't any reason
We can't dance the Christmas polka

And love just fills the air

While dancing the Christmas polka.
The merry Christmas polka, 
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance

Watch the sweethearts kissing' 
As they dance underneath the mistletoe

The merry Christmas polka.

Snow covered rooftops
Lights on the trees
The sound of singing
I hear down
Every street
Families
Have gathered
From miles away
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
You see that old tree
Down Cotton Lane
Those lights
Keep shining
It's always the same
We hear
The church bells
Ring out to say
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Swing the lights
And hang
The stockings
Decorate
With green and red
Made the cookies
For old Santa
Made a runway
For his sled
Singing carols
On a sleigh ride
Gather 'round
The manger scene
Open presents
Read the letter
And together
We will sing
Oh
Merry Christmas
Joy to the world
For every nation
For every boy
And girl
Let's light a candle
For peace we pray
Oh
Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
It's Christmas day
It's Christmas day
Let's light a candle
For peace we pray
Oh
Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Oh
Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day

The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas, darling
We're apart, that's true
But I can dream
And in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish
On this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
Merry Christmas, darling 
You're the dude from high school I see at the gym
Or a friend of a friend, or a second cousin
You're a co-worker I sometimes eat lunch with
You're one of my many acquaintances
You know Christmas is about spending time with friends and family
But just because you're not in one of those 2 categories
Doesn't mean that I won't still do something special for you
Cause Christmas is about giving
So here's what I'll do
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna type Merry Christmas exclamation point, and then press send
Maybe I'll just copy and paste it (From a previous text)
Well it's only two words, I might as well just type it (Less complicated)
If you're thinking of calling me to thank me, oh please don't (That's not how
this works)
Texting is as far as this relationship goes (And keep your response brief)
I have way more important people in my life, you're not even in the top fifty
It's not that I don't care about you, well yeah I don't really care about you
But, doesn't mean that I won't still do, something special for you
Cause Christmas is about giving
So here's what I'll do
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna send you a Christmas text (Christmas text, Christmas text)
I'm gonna type Merry Christmas exclamation point, and then press send
I don't care enough to call, but I don't not care enough to do nothing, all
I don't care enough to call, but I don't not care enough to do nothing, all
So I'll type Merry Christmas exclamation point and then press send
Merry Christmas exclamation point and then press send
Merry Christmas exclamation point and then press send
And to all of my non-Christian friends, I will text you: "Hey, dude what's goin
on? We should totes hang next week". 
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
If you don't believe me, well you should believe me
'Cause this is the best Christmas song, so listen to it now
Christmas is my favorite Christmastime of the year
Bells are jiggling and the angels are making Jesus
It's a silent night except for my neighbor's washing machine
It's very loud; that's why I'm wearing my second-favorite earmuffs
Santa Claus is coming, so you better be naughty or nice
He has a beard so you can't even see his neck
He flies around with horses that have branches on their ears
'Cause there are no earmuffs in the North Pole; there are only trees
He brings presents to the kids, but he doesn't wear mittens
Probably because they make his hands very itchy
Leave Santa milk and cookies so he can have a snack
It'll be easy for him to pick them up 'cause he won't have mittens on his hands
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
Other Christmas songs don't even talk about Christmas stuff
But this is the best Christmas song, so keep listening to it now
Santa comes in from the chimney, so don't block it with a mattress
And if you don't have a chimney, make one out of a mattress
Santa, what is the present you're gonna put in my tree this year?
I hope it's not the shoes that I already have
I already have those shoes, so that's not a very good present
A better present would be to make my family still alive
Or a bicycle; that would be good, too
Also, can you move your beard? I want to see what your neck looks like
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
Mittens aren't even a super important thing
But this is the best Christmas song, so keep listening to it now
Everybody do the Christmas arms
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, arms, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, arms
Everybody do the Christmas face
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, face, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, face
Everybody do the Christmas talking
A-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, talking, ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, talking
Everybody don't put mittens on
No mittens, no mittens, no mittens, no
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, I tricked you to not putting mittens on
Now your hands are cold; that was my Christmas trick
Another trick I like to do is I give people chocolate
And I'd say "Happy Easter," and they'd say "What? It's not even Easter!"
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
This is the best Christmas song that ever existed
Maybe Santa's neck is a different color or something
But this is the best Christmas song, and now it's finished 
Hang all the mistletoe
Im gonna get to know you better, yeah
This christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun its gonna be together, yeah 
This christmas
Fireside is blazing bright
Were caroling through the night
And this christmas, will be 
A very special christmas, for me yeah ha
Break it down, break it down now
mmmm
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
Were caroling through the night
And this christmas, will be
A very special christmas, for me 
ohhh

Merry Christmas
This christmas
This christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
Were caroling through the night
And this christmas, will be 
A very special christmas, for me ohhh
Break it down, break it down now
ohhh ohhhh
And give your heart to a friend now
What do you want for christmas? 
My idea of a perfect Christmas
Is to spend it with you
In a party or dinner for two
Anywhere would do
Celebrating the yuletide season
Always lights up our lives
Simple pleasures are made special too
When they're shared with you
Looking through some old photographs
Faces and friends we'll always remember
Watching busy shoppers rushing about
In the cool breeze of December
Sparkling lights all over town
Children's carols in the air
By the Christmas tree
A shower of stardust on your hair
I can't think of a better Christmas
Than my wish coming true
And my wish is that you'd let me spend
My whole life with you
Looking through some old photographs
Faces and friends we'll always remember
Watching busy shoppers rushing about
In the cool breeze of December
Sparkling lights all over town
Children's carols in the air
By the Christmas tree
A shower of stardust on your hair
I can't think of a better Christmas
Than my wish coming true
And my wish is that you'd let me spend
My whole life with you
My idea of a perfect Christmas
Is spending it with you 
Whenever I see girls and boys
Selling lanterns on the street
I remember the child in the manger as he sleeps
Wherever there are people
Giving gifts exchanging cards
I believe that Christmas is truly in our hearts
Let's light our Christmas trees for a bright tomorrow
Where nations are at peace,
And all are one in God
Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
This season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts
In every prayer and every song
The community unites celebrating the birth of our savior Jesus Christ
Let love like that starlight on that first Christmas morn
Lead us back to the manger where Christ the child was born
So come let us rejoice
Come and sing the Christmas carol with one big joyful voice
Proclaim the name of the Lord
Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
This season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts
Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
The season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts 
I don't care what the neighbors say
Christmas time is near
I don't care what anyone says
Christmas is full of cheer
All I know is that Santa's sleigh
Is makin it's way to the U.S.A.
I wish it was Christmas today
I wish it was Christmas today
I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh
I wish it was Christmas today
I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh
All I know is that Santa Claus
Don't care about breaking or applying laws
I wish it was, I wish it was,
Wish it was, wish it was, oh
I don't care about anything else
Christmas is almost here
And I don't care what the news man said
Christmas is full of cheer
I don't care about anything
Except hearing those sleigh bells a'ring-a-ding, ding
I wish it was Christmas today
In the good old U.S. of A.
I wish it was Christmas today
I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh
I wish it was Christmas today
I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh
Santa's bringing goodies to the boys and girls
In every nook and cranny of this crazy ass world
I want it, I want it,
I want it, I want it 
I just can't wait
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby (Yeahhh)
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
For my own
Baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is

Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up christmas list
Not for myself
But for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up christmas list
As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath our tree
But heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal
A hurting human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, oh
This is my grown up christmas list
This is my only life long wish
This is my grown up christmas list

We could go outside and play in the snow
I could make a little fire we could break it down eskimos
Simply state it there's no place I rather be
It's christmas time for you and me girl
Spread love peace and joy throughout the world
While every little boy is trying to find something for his favourite girl
Yes baby your santa clause is on his way
He'll be keeping you satisfied Christmas day
What can I do, to make your dreams come true
For christmas
What can I bring, to make your heart sing
So you'll be mine
For Christmas
Have a merry Christmas babe
Hey girl
They'll be jingle bells for you and me
We'll snuggle by the christmas tree
A celebration of green and gold
We'll sing along to Nat King Cole
Get tiding to all and to all good cheer
I just wanna know my baby is here
Keeping me warm all through the night yea
I got an angel by my side
What can I do to make your dreams come true
For Christmas
What can I bring to make your heart sing tonight
So you will be mine
Christmas is finally here
I'll be yours anytime of the year
And I would do anything
All I want is the joy you bring
I'll give you my heart wrapped up in a bow
Fa la la la la all the way we go
It's Christmas when I'm loving you
What can I do to make your dreams come true
For Christmas
Be mine for Christmas
What can I bring you girl
I wanna make your dreams come true
So you'll be mine
I wanna be yours
Will you be mine babe?
Yes be mine
For Christmas
Be mine for Christmas
I just wanna love you girl
I will do anything baby
We can cuddle over by the fire
Yeah I like that
Have a merry Christmas girl
You rarely get that don't you
You said anything
Girl I'll give you anything 
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning
And my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories
Of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew
And used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to 
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know
Would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps
On this Christmas Eve.
The most joyous Christmas
If luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas
Brought you home to me
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you, I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you 
so sad but so true
Christmas without you
I just can't get used to 
I just have no use
For Christmas without you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you 
You know that I want you
You know that I love you
I need you 
I want you
Oh, yes I do!
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you 
You know that I want you 
Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow
Let's make a break some Christmas dear
I know the place to go
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true
On Christmas Island may your Christmas dreams come true 
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring
There are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
And there won't be snow in Africa
This Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
 
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
I'm on my way
Naughty children be afraid
One at a time
I'll take you all away
(Na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ringing bells all around
Welcome Christmas time
Every kid in this town
Cannot sleep at night
But I have been so bad
Santa will not bring me gifts and...
Krampus might come
What is this noise on the backyard?
Watch out
The animal
Coming to get all the children
Faster
You've got to hide
Can't run away from the darkness
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
'Cause nobody wants to be dragged by the Krampus
Everybody better be good at Christmas
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-naughty Christmas
Satyr with chains
Rowdy children be afraid
One at a time
I'll take you all away
(Na-na-na-na-na-na)
He's inside in the house
Looking for my room
Someone drank the glass of milk
That I've put on the floor
Have I been so bad
Santa will not bring me girts and...
Krampus will come
What is this noise on my door?
Watch out
The animal
Coming to get all the children
Faster
You've got to hide
Can't run away from the darkness
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
'Cause nobody wants to be dragged by the Krampus
Everybody better be good at Christmas
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-naughty Christmas
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
Everybody better be good at Christmas
Krampus comes
Watch out
The animal
Coming to get all the children
Faster
You've got to hide
Can't run away from the darkness
Watch out
The animal
Coming to get all the children
Faster
You've got to hide
Can't run away from the darkness
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
'Cause nobody wants to be dragged by the Krampus
Everybody better be good at Christmas
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-naughty Christmas
Everybody wants to be good at Christmas
'Cause nobody wants to be dragged by the Krampus
Everybody better be good at Christmas
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-naughty Christmas

Cherry! Cherry! Boom! Boom! 
Christmas is the time of year
For being with the ones we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feeling
Watching the ones we love having so much fun
I was sitting by the fireside
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that He came to us
Why can't it remain all through the year
Each day the same
Oh, that's what I wanna hear
It's truly amazing
That spirit of Christmas
All the kinfolk gather round
The lovely Christmas tree
Hearts are glowing full of joy
Sense the gifts that we're giving
And the love that we're living
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Oh, that's what I wanna hear
It's truly amazing
That spirit of Christmas
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Oh, that's what I wanna hear
It's truly amazing
That spirit of Christmas
It's truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly amazing
That spirit of Christmas
It's truly amazing
