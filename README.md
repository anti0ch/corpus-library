# corpus-library
A public collection of various corpora to be used for training predictive linguistic models of all stripes and all flavors.

## Current datasets:

- capes.txt: A list of crowdsourced names for 'parahumans', both superheroes, supervillains, and others with nominal or ambiguous alignment, submitted by members of the Parahumans community and acquired from the original work of fiction, Worm. Best suited for character-level models.

- dril.txt, dril.json: A full corpus of every tweet by prolific 'Weird Twitter' personality @dril up to February 05, 2018. The .txt file does not differentiate between line breaks within tweets and line breaks delimiting tweets, so be warned. The .json file is much tidier about these sorts of things.

- fall-out-boy.txt: A mostly full corpus of the lyrics of every song in the Fall Out Boy discography. Some songs have probably slipped through the cracks, and I apologize.

- turtles.txt: A list of the names of every turtle species scraped from https://animalsake.com/different-types-of-turtles. Turtles with 'or' names have been separated into two entries. The list is fully lowercase to provide more uniformity in a relatively small dataset, and hyphens have been replaced with spaces.

If you are interested in the addition of more corpuses to this repository and have one specific one in mind, or have one you'd like to submit yourself, feel free to contact me via Twitter @cosmo_chou.

## Current project:

None at present. Feel free to suggest.
