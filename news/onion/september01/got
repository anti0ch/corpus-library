/n‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7 Finale: See the Best Celebrity Reactions!/nWhat did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale?EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming. Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is “a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.” But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon?“I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind,” Headey said. “And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.”Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: “You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen. For a time. Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three. Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.”While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down. While we’re not touching that “more beautiful” bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow (er, Aegon Targaryen) and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead. “I think her lie will be very shocking,” Headey predicted. “She’s such a bitch. She’s so unforgiving of everybody.”Also check out Headey starring in a new Kasabian music video.Read our “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

— Game of Thrones podcastGame of Thrones will return to HBO for its final season in the back half of 2018 or in 2019 for six episodes.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/nDuring the seventh season of Game of Thrones, EW’s Darren Franich and Shirley Li have ventured into the weeds of Westeros every week to untangle the latest burning questions, ruminate over theories, and trace the show’s remaining connections to the unfinished books. Consider this EW’s small council, made of two people far too obsessed with everything Thrones. This year’s burning question: Besides the Great War, what will happen in season 8?SHIRLEY: Darren, here’s where we stand. The Wall has fallen, and Tormund and Beric possiblywith it. (They wouldn’t give Thoros of Myr a longer send-off than the one for Mr. Giantsbane, would they?) The Army of the Dead have Flappy Bird for a dragon and blue fire as their official interpretation of what a zombie dragon would breathe. So the Great War is coming!But… that can’t be all there is to the final six episodes, can it? A series of extended battles, one after the next, between the Night King’s forces and those of Jon and Daenerys doesn’t sound like a very interesting way for this show to go out, does it? Other than the looming showdown up North, whatever Cersei’s planning down South appears to be the biggest question mark. Not that it wasn’t logical for her to turn her back on even the most; the move felt like peak paranoid Cersei, who’s always been more interested in keeping control of her power over working for the greater good. In fact, this finale gave Cersei a far bigger spotlight than I expected it would: She got to be the star of the Dragonpit stage, the con artist in her confrontation with Tyrion, and then grit her teeth as she nearly had the Mountain take out Jaime. That’s a lot of time spent on a dead woman walking, and I can’t help but think that D&D have something larger in store for her next season.That said, Darren, what do you think will be her next move? We spent all season underestimating her longevity, but now she’s sent Euron off to bring her the Golden Company and she’s turned her back on both of her brothers. Once she has her sellswords and her elephants (can Euron even transport them?), what will she do? March on Winterfell for, I don’t know, fun and extra resources? And could Euron bring back more than what he set out to find? I’m sure Westeros has enjoyed all the attention lavished on it this year, but maybe we should start thinking about those players in Essos again.DARREN: The strangest achievement of this very strange season is how utterly it rescrambled my loyalties as a viewer. Next season, the remaining Starks will unite in Winterfell, and Jon’s Targaryen ancestry will come to light, and regular orange flame will mix with blue flame to create purple flame, maybe? And I would be totally happy if the season 8 premiere never leaves King’s Landing. All Hail Queen Cersei, the only strategist left in Westeros! Bring on the Golden Company! March, elephants, march! Call her a cynic, call her a villain, but at least there’s still someone on this show with the foresight to worry about tomorrow’s war today.I guess you could criticize Cersei for a lack of foresight. The Army of the Dead will kill everyone, and therefore everyone must fight back. We’ve heard this constantly: It’s a simple moral binary. The fact that the Night King is commonly accepted as a climate-change metaphor seems to only deepen the sense of Cersei as a selfish evil. (Queen Lannister = ExxonMobil!) But George R.R. Martin constructed his original story with the thrilling amorality of actual history. And in that tradition, Cersei skipped the metaphors and did the math. She’s got two enemies, essentially unstoppable. One enemy is way up north and has an army of zombies. Another enemy is going up north and has one less dragon than she used to. Whoever wins, Cersei loses in the long-term. “Let the monsters kill each other” is her gamble, and as gambles go, I think it’s a sharp one. And I know some people will say, “BUT THE NIGHT KING HAS AN UNDEAD DRAGON WHO COULD DESTROY KING’S LANDING TOMORROW!” Good news on that front: Qyburn’s got a ballista, and there’s a certain island full of dragonglass not far from King’s Landing that is about to be vacated.Plus, this gamble involves bringing in the Golden Company, a mercenary subculture that believes in kicking ass and conspicuous consumption. The Golden Company haven’t appeared on the show yet, but they have an intriguing role in A Dance With Dragons. In that book, they become the official muscle for a potential Iron Throne-sitter in a precarious position. Holy crap, Shirley, what if Cersei is becoming Young Griff??? If that’s the case, her next move will be to shore up her dominance of the South. Hell, since Cersei is so un-nostalgic that she left Casterly Rock empty, maybe she’ll even flee to a more defensible position, as far as possible from the Great War up north. Does it even snow in Dorne?What do you think her next move is, Shirley? And how do you interpret the burgeoning, befuddling theory that she is somehow in cahoots with Tyrion? My hot take on That Tyrion Shot Everyone’s Talking About is that it means “nothing.” But what do I know? I thought Littlefinger had a plan!SHIRLEY: I think what I’m struggling with when it comes to imagining an ending for all this is that I always thought it would be… bigger. That sounds like an unfair assessment to make with a show that’s managed to deliver three dragon battles in one season, but I think I had expected this to be a far more complicated game than it’s turned out to be. I’m glad you brought up Young Griff; that remains one of the plot points (aside from the Dornish conspiracy, and everything up north with Skagos and Wyman Manderly and, oof, I could go on) I wish the show had time to adapt. Young Griff scrambled the pieces on the board late in the game, because we had a whole new series of questions to contend with: Is he really the supposedly dead Aegon, whisked away by Varys to be bred into the perfect Westerosi king? Is he a Blackfyre posing as a Targaryen? What will Dany think?In other words, I think what we lack is a proper wild card to raise the stakes further. The dead is the enemy, sure, but let’s not forget the living. Maybe in the show, that wild card will be the Golden Company, maybe it’ll be Melisandre and the red priestesses, or maybe D&D really is setting up Tyrion to be a final-act game-changer. I know you’re not into the theory that Tyrion is working with Cersei now that she’s carrying a child, but I’m going to be watching him closely whenever the next season arrives. It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead. If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn. (The camera lingered on him and that wight arm a little too long, in my opinion.) She’ll be the undead wild card. Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do. But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind. Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny. Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance (and more!) with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory?I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei. I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan. And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula. There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology. (His methods are unsound, but didn’t Da Vinci supposedly hire graverobbers?) Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama. But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home. Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell. Such an event would unite several disparate story strands. The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark. The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell. And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell.” I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements. And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care?And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall/Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax?SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman (“The Spoils of War” is the best episode this season, don’t @ me) as directors. I want six movies. I want at least one huge battle episode. I want an episode told through flashbacks. I want an end to deus ex machinas. I want a Brienne-centric hour. I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really. I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith. I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell” — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people. The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series’ endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season. We know about the red priestesses’ Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens’ Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god (will we ever see more Children of the Forest?), and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys wield a sword/arm/thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here. Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him/her/itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter. Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye. (Book Stuff again, yikes.) Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks. All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of ‘em before it’s too late. And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes?DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven (Maiden, Mother, Warrior, Stranger), and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God. And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of “All Along the Watchtower” cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell. And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid. Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy. This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters. I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy. If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire?I truly don’t know. Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply. Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is. I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either. My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide. After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.I haven’t thought much about the Starks’ future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician. I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war. The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms. And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert. A détente ensues. The years flash by. We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later. Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies. Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list. They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.“If you kill me,” Cersei says, “the country will descend into chaos.” The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya. And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten. “What’s more important,” Cersei asks Arya, “your vengeance or your country?”While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us. A country at peace… but maybe not for long.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” We suspected it was coming. We were nearly certain. So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along. Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark. But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North. But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne. And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all. And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow. He’s Aegon Targaryen. Yes, we’re still getting used to that too. Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon (though we’re also not entirely sure what an Aegon looks like).The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty. Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen (unless his brother, the doomed infant Aegon,* is also counted).Jon (we’re going to keep using that name for now) and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season. And it raises some big questions:1. Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim? (Emilia Clarke has strong feelings about this in our post-finale interview).2. Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all. Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later. It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.3. Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens (Daenerys is the product of incest herself). But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4. Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous (she believes she can’t after her child with Drogo was stillborn, the witch cursed her and she “birthed” three dragons instead). Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate?5. Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords. Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if/when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir. One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a “foreigner” like Daenerys.6. How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes. Even her own brothers.7. And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season?More “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

The infant Aegon, their other child, and Elia were all killed by Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegan during Robert’s Rebellion. These were the deaths that Prince Oberyn Martell was set on avenging during his all-too-brief time at King’s Landing before he was killed during a trial by combat.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/nGame of Thrones: Lena Headey Reveals What Cersei Really Thought of Daenerys

That sounds like an unfair assessment to make with a show that’s managed to deliver three dragon battles in one season, but I think I had expected this to be a far more complicated game than it’s turned out to be. I’m glad you brought up Young Griff; that remains one of the plot points (aside from the Dornish conspiracy, and everything up north with Skagos and Wyman Manderly and, oof, I could go on) I wish the show had time to adapt. Young Griff scrambled the pieces on the board late in the game, because we had a whole new series of questions to contend with: Is he really the supposedly dead Aegon, whisked away by Varys to be bred into the perfect Westerosi king? Is he a Blackfyre posing as a Targaryen? What will Dany think?In other words, I think what we lack is a proper wild card to raise the stakes further. The dead is the enemy, sure, but let’s not forget the living. Maybe in the show, that wild card will be the Golden Company, maybe it’ll be Melisandre and the red priestesses, or maybe D&D really is setting up Tyrion to be a final-act game-changer. I know you’re not into the theory that Tyrion is working with Cersei now that she’s carrying a child, but I’m going to be watching him closely whenever the next season arrives. It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead. If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn. (The camera lingered on him and that wight arm a little too long, in my opinion.) She’ll be the undead wild card. Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do. But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind. Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny. Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance (and more!) with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory?I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei. I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan. And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula. There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology. (His methods are unsound, but didn’t Da Vinci supposedly hire graverobbers?) Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama. But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home. Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell. Such an event would unite several disparate story strands. The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark. The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell. And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell.” I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements. And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care?And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall/Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax?SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman (“The Spoils of War” is the best episode this season, don’t @ me) as directors. I want six movies. I want at least one huge battle episode. I want an episode told through flashbacks. I want an end to deus ex machinas. I want a Brienne-centric hour. I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really. I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith. I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell” — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people. The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series’ endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season. We know about the red priestesses’ Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens’ Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god (will we ever see more Children of the Forest?), and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys wield a sword/arm/thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here. Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him/her/itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter. Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye. (Book Stuff again, yikes.) Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks. All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of ‘em before it’s too late. And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes?DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven (Maiden, Mother, Warrior, Stranger), and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God. And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of “All Along the Watchtower” cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell. And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid. Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy. This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters. I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy. If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire?I truly don’t know. Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply. Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is. I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either. My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide. After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.I haven’t thought much about the Starks’ future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician. I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war. The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms. And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert. A détente ensues. The years flash by. We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later. Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies. Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list. They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.“If you kill me,” Cersei says, “the country will descend into chaos.” The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya. And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten. “What’s more important,” Cersei asks Arya, “your vengeance or your country?”While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us. A country at peace… but maybe not for long.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/nWhat did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale?EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming. Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is “a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.” But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon?“I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind,” Headey said. “And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.”Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: “You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen. For a time. Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three. Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.”While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down. While we’re not touching that “more beautiful” bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow (er, Aegon Targaryen) and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead. “I think her lie will be very shocking,” Headey predicted. “She’s such a bitch. She’s so unforgiving of everybody.”Also check out Headey starring in a new Kasabian music video.Read our “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

See you next year!/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” We suspected it was coming. We were nearly certain. So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along. Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark. But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North. But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne. And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all. And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow. He’s Aegon Targaryen. Yes, we’re still getting used to that too. Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon (though we’re also not entirely sure what an Aegon looks like).The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty. Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen (unless his brother, the doomed infant Aegon,* is also counted).Jon (we’re going to keep using that name for now) and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season. And it raises some big questions:1. Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim? (Emilia Clarke has strong feelings about this in our post-finale interview).2. Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all. Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later. It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.3. Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens (Daenerys is the product of incest herself). But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4. Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous (she believes she can’t after her child with Drogo was stillborn, the witch cursed her and she “birthed” three dragons instead). Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate?5. Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords. Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if/when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir. One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a “foreigner” like Daenerys.6. How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes. Even her own brothers.7. And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season?More “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

[This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!]
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup. Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.
Related: There's Sexy Jon Snow Halloween Costume…
Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan. Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself (below)! 
Queen vs. Queen vs. King

Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north. Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons. We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister. But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co. could see for themselves that wights are indeed real. Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish

Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn. As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters. Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was (once again) trying to use her. Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason. In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble. It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat. Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
/n

Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode. Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

The Game of Thrones season seven finale was satisfying for many reasons, but none more than the episode's title teased us about.
After (seemingly) uniting the Houses together to fight against the army of the dead, Fire finally laid with Ice. The Dragon danced with the wolf. Daenerys Targaryen climbed Mt. Jon Snow, and he in return took a plunge into her dragon pit — and it was GLORIOUS.
Not as glorious, however, when considering that Westeros' hottest love scene played out while fans were reminded that the two characters are actually aunt and nephew!

Though fans may have made peace with the fact that Jon and Dany are secretly related, the characters have a lot to be nauseated about. At least, that's what Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington teased would be the response after the Targaryen truth bomb gets dropped in season eight.
Speaking to EW, Clarke considered her character's reaction to the news that she was fucking her own fire and blood, laughing: 
"Ewwwww! I think that's how it's going to go. I get the toothbrush—"
Well, we can't really blame her, can we? Especially given the fact that Jon Snow's true identity — Aegon Targaryen — now threatens Dany's claim to the Iron Throne.
In the finale, it was revealed (again) that Jon/Aegon's parents Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were secretly married, making him the true heir to rule Westeros.
According to Clarke, that's going to put quite the spike in the new relationship — because Dany ain't about to share:
"I've worked so hard, I don't want to share that throne. No. The throne's big enough for one dragon bum, and that's mine. That's it!"
Loverboy Harington wasn't as concerned with the impending doom of Jon and Dany as for how to realistically ramp up their chemistry during their short time together over the past four episodes.
Related: Trump Administration — As GoT Characters!
Speaking on the pressure to play out the biggest romance of the series, he explained:
"Usually you go into a movie and meet [your costar] for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time. But if you've known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we're both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, ‘What's the sexual tension in this scene?' and she's like, ‘Stop talking about sexual tension!' It's a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching."
Clarke had more confidence in their palpable chemistry, adding:
"Yeah [I would say], ‘Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don't keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time… I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it's a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep."
Yep! Clark notes the big realization for Dany was when Jon left Dragonstone to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight:
"She's just like: Why don't I want you do go? Why don't I want you— doooooon't fall for him. Don't do it! There's a battle going in on herself."
As for Jon's reaction to learning who he truly is — and who he's truly banging — Harington would only say:
"I said to Emilia it's going to be a really cool scene when they find out."
But as for what they'll do after they find out, only the writers know! He added:
"That part of it, I can't predict. It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other."
Seeing as this is Game of Thrones, we already know which tragic end to expect. So let's enjoy the ride while we still can — we know Jon and Dany sure are!

[This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!]
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup. Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.
Related: There's Sexy Jon Snow Halloween Costume…
Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan. Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself (below)! 
Queen vs. Queen vs. King

Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north. Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons. We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister. But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co. could see for themselves that wights are indeed real. Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish

Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn. As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters. Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was (once again) trying to use her. Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason. In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble. It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat. Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
/n

Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode. Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

Season seven has been Game Of Thrones' most watched ever — but also possibly its most panned.
Longtime fans have criticized the shorter season for inconsistent character moments, rushed plotlines, and logic problems.
It's been said the show is losing its edge as writers, no longer able to lean on the books, aren't sure where to go (even though season six is the show's most acclaimed, and they were flying blind there, too).

On Sunday night, even another cable network took a swipe at the show. After hit show Rick and Morty, Adult Swim used one of its classic interstitial jokes — just the white lettering on black background — to savagely say R.I.P. to the show: 

But Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon wants fans to know he his show is NOT down with that shade.
In fact, he released an epic takedown of the anonymous writer's "lazy, craftless jab at the WRITING on my favorite show."

[SPOILERS AHEAD]
[But come on, it was like four days ago!]
It's been half a week since the Game Of Thrones finale, and fans are still trying to unpack everything that happened — and knowing the show won't be back until 2019, they're in no rush to be done.
Amid the dread over the coming White Walkers and weird feelings about Jon and Dany's… relations… there was one moment of pure delight — seeing Sansa and Arya FINALLY turn the tables and take out master manipulator Peter Baelish.
Related: Full Recap Of The Dragon And The Wolf HERE!
After several episodes in which Littlefinger attempted to drive a wedge between the very different Stark sisters, they finally realized what was up and brought his machinations to light in front of an audience — before cutting his throat with the same knife he sent to kill Bran way back in season one.
But the show took its time getting to that bloody resolution; the last time we saw the sisters together, Arya (Maisie Williams) was literally threatening to kill Sansa (Sophie Turner) and wear her face. So what happened??
The theory put forth by fans confused by scary Arya (Scarya?) was that she and Sansa were play acting the whole time, just pretending to want to kill each other for the benefit of Littlefinger's spying.
The long con theory was confirmed by the finale twist, right? Actually, a deleted scene changes  the context of that final confrontation and the family face offs beforehand.
In an interview with Variety, Bran actor Isaac Hempstead-Wright explained:

"We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran's door and says, 'I need your help,' or something along those lines. So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she's like, 'Oh, shit.'"
The existence of that scene proves that Sansa and Arya were NOT plotting against Littlefinger the whole time but rather they needed to finally talk to their creepy Three-Eyed Raven bro to get their heads on straight.
VOTE: Who Do YOU Think Will Win The Iron Throne?? 
We're actually glad that scene was cut — sorry, Peter, deleted — because then we would have seen the twist coming. And it was so much sweeter to get the surprise.
Also, we prefer the fan theory. The sisters being too clever, even without magic eyes, is such a strong message.

"She's just like: Why don't I want you do go? Why don't I want you— doooooon't fall for him. Don't do it! There's a battle going in on herself."
As for Jon's reaction to learning who he truly is — and who he's truly banging — Harington would only say:
"I said to Emilia it's going to be a really cool scene when they find out."
But as for what they'll do after they find out, only the writers know! He added:
"That part of it, I can't predict. It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other."
Seeing as this is Game of Thrones, we already know which tragic end to expect. So let's enjoy the ride while we still can — we know Jon and Dany sure are!

[This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!]
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup. Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.

Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan. Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself (below)! 
Queen vs. Queen vs. King

Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north. Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons. We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister. But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co. could see for themselves that wights are indeed real. Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish

Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn. As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters. Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was (once again) trying to use her. Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason. In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble. It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat. Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up

Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode. Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

What did YOU think of the finale?? Be sure to share your thoughts (below)!

What the actual fuck!
Newly-released footage from a Utah police officer's body camera shows University Hospital nurse, Alex Wubbels, screaming as she was forcefully arrested for refusing to illegally draw blood from an unconscious patient.
Related: Pregnant Woman Killed By Seattle Police Shot 7 Times
In the beginning of the video, Wubbels is seen calmly explaining that the car accident victim was required to give consent for a blood sample, be under arrest, or there needed to be a warrant. Since none of those things were applicable, Wubbels could not give Salt Lake detective Jeff Payne what he was looking for.
What happens next is truly disturbing.

                    Did Aaron Carter Have a "Mental Breakdown" Over Breakup on Twitter?
                







Yikes!

 MORE >>





Aaron Carter was arrested in Georgia Saturday (July 15th) on suspicion of driving under the influence, pot possession, and obstruction of law enforcement officers.

The singer was charged with three misdemeanors — DUI, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, and possession of drug-related objects — after he was taken in custody on Saturday (July 15th), according to police records. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was also arrested for alleged drug-related offenses.
Carter’s bail was set at $4,610, while Parker’s was set at $4,360. They reportedly posted bail Sunday afternoon.
Soon after his arrest, the 29-year-old took to social media to slam his older brother, Nick Carter, who publicly reached out to Aaron when he heard the news of his DUI. “To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,” Nick tweeted. “Family isn’t always easy, be we’re all here for you.”

“If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum? That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down,” Aaron retorted. “I love my family despite it through thick and thin.”
Nick appeared to respond to his younger sibling by retweeting a note from sister Lauren Kitt Carter, reading, “Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!”

In a statement released my Aaron, he alleged he was “targeted” by the police because of his “celebrity.” He also claimed he was  not in the vehicle at the time of his arrest, and was denied a right to an attorney when authorities booked him.
“Aaron’s been traveling non-stop doing promotions on his latest hit single ‘Sooner or Later’ across the southeast when his automobile had a new tire put on it and it went out of alignment,” the statement read. “Aaron drove the vehicle to the nearest Auto Zone in Cornelia, Georgia. After being at the store and requesting help to get his alignment fixed, he was arrested inside by several police officers with aggression. The police also revoked his rights to have an attorney.”
The statement continued, “Aaron holds a medical license for medical marijuana for his long standing anxiety. He feels his ‘celebrity’ was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter. The video from Auto Zone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.”

Sansa & Arya Stark Take On Carpool Karaoke/nDuring the seventh season of Game of Thrones, EW’s Darren Franich and Shirley Li have ventured into the weeds of Westeros every week to untangle the latest burning questions, ruminate over theories, and trace the show’s remaining connections to the unfinished books. Consider this EW’s small council, made of two people far too obsessed with everything Thrones. This year’s burning question: Besides the Great War, what will happen in season 8?SHIRLEY: Darren, here’s where we stand. The Wall has fallen, and Tormund and Beric possiblywith it. (They wouldn’t give Thoros of Myr a longer send-off than the one for Mr. Giantsbane, would they?) The Army of the Dead have Flappy Bird for a dragon and blue fire as their official interpretation of what a zombie dragon would breathe. So the Great War is coming!But… that can’t be all there is to the final six episodes, can it? A series of extended battles, one after the next, between the Night King’s forces and those of Jon and Daenerys doesn’t sound like a very interesting way for this show to go out, does it? Other than the looming showdown up North, whatever Cersei’s planning down South appears to be the biggest question mark. Not that it wasn’t logical for her to turn her back on even the most; the move felt like peak paranoid Cersei, who’s always been more interested in keeping control of her power over working for the greater good. In fact, this finale gave Cersei a far bigger spotlight than I expected it would: She got to be the star of the Dragonpit stage, the con artist in her confrontation with Tyrion, and then grit her teeth as she nearly had the Mountain take out Jaime. That’s a lot of time spent on a dead woman walking, and I can’t help but think that D&D have something larger in store for her next season.That said, Darren, what do you think will be her next move? We spent all season underestimating her longevity, but now she’s sent Euron off to bring her the Golden Company and she’s turned her back on both of her brothers. Once she has her sellswords and her elephants (can Euron even transport them?), what will she do? March on Winterfell for, I don’t know, fun and extra resources? And could Euron bring back more than what he set out to find? I’m sure Westeros has enjoyed all the attention lavished on it this year, but maybe we should start thinking about those players in Essos again.DARREN: The strangest achievement of this very strange season is how utterly it rescrambled my loyalties as a viewer. Next season, the remaining Starks will unite in Winterfell, and Jon’s Targaryen ancestry will come to light, and regular orange flame will mix with blue flame to create purple flame, maybe? And I would be totally happy if the season 8 premiere never leaves King’s Landing. All Hail Queen Cersei, the only strategist left in Westeros! Bring on the Golden Company! March, elephants, march! Call her a cynic, call her a villain, but at least there’s still someone on this show with the foresight to worry about tomorrow’s war today.I guess you could criticize Cersei for a lack of foresight. The Army of the Dead will kill everyone, and therefore everyone must fight back. We’ve heard this constantly: It’s a simple moral binary. The fact that the Night King is commonly accepted as a climate-change metaphor seems to only deepen the sense of Cersei as a selfish evil. (Queen Lannister = ExxonMobil!) But George R.R. Martin constructed his original story with the thrilling amorality of actual history. And in that tradition, Cersei skipped the metaphors and did the math. She’s got two enemies, essentially unstoppable. One enemy is way up north and has an army of zombies. Another enemy is going up north and has one less dragon than she used to. Whoever wins, Cersei loses in the long-term. “Let the monsters kill each other” is her gamble, and as gambles go, I think it’s a sharp one. And I know some people will say, “BUT THE NIGHT KING HAS AN UNDEAD DRAGON WHO COULD DESTROY KING’S LANDING TOMORROW!” Good news on that front: Qyburn’s got a ballista, and there’s a certain island full of dragonglass not far from King’s Landing that is about to be vacated.Plus, this gamble involves bringing in the Golden Company, a mercenary subculture that believes in kicking ass and conspicuous consumption. The Golden Company haven’t appeared on the show yet, but they have an intriguing role in A Dance With Dragons. In that book, they become the official muscle for a potential Iron Throne-sitter in a precarious position. Holy crap, Shirley, what if Cersei is becoming Young Griff??? If that’s the case, her next move will be to shore up her dominance of the South. Hell, since Cersei is so un-nostalgic that she left Casterly Rock empty, maybe she’ll even flee to a more defensible position, as far as possible from the Great War up north. Does it even snow in Dorne?What do you think her next move is, Shirley? And how do you interpret the burgeoning, befuddling theory that she is somehow in cahoots with Tyrion? My hot take on That Tyrion Shot Everyone’s Talking About is that it means “nothing.” But what do I know? I thought Littlefinger had a plan!SHIRLEY: I think what I’m struggling with when it comes to imagining an ending for all this is that I always thought it would be… bigger. That sounds like an unfair assessment to make with a show that’s managed to deliver three dragon battles in one season, but I think I had expected this to be a far more complicated game than it’s turned out to be. I’m glad you brought up Young Griff; that remains one of the plot points (aside from the Dornish conspiracy, and everything up north with Skagos and Wyman Manderly and, oof, I could go on) I wish the show had time to adapt. Young Griff scrambled the pieces on the board late in the game, because we had a whole new series of questions to contend with: Is he really the supposedly dead Aegon, whisked away by Varys to be bred into the perfect Westerosi king? Is he a Blackfyre posing as a Targaryen? What will Dany think?In other words, I think what we lack is a proper wild card to raise the stakes further. The dead is the enemy, sure, but let’s not forget the living. Maybe in the show, that wild card will be the Golden Company, maybe it’ll be Melisandre and the red priestesses, or maybe D&D really is setting up Tyrion to be a final-act game-changer. I know you’re not into the theory that Tyrion is working with Cersei now that she’s carrying a child, but I’m going to be watching him closely whenever the next season arrives. It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead. If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn. (The camera lingered on him and that wight arm a little too long, in my opinion.) She’ll be the undead wild card. Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do. But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind. Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny. Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance (and more!) with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory?I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei. I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan. And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula. There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology. (His methods are unsound, but didn’t Da Vinci supposedly hire graverobbers?) Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama. But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home. Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell. Such an event would unite several disparate story strands. The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark. The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell. And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell.” I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements. And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care?And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall/Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax?SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman (“The Spoils of War” is the best episode this season, don’t @ me) as directors. I want six movies. I want at least one huge battle episode. I want an episode told through flashbacks. I want an end to deus ex machinas. I want a Brienne-centric hour. I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really. I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith. I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase “Winter fell at Winterfell” — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people. The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series’ endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season. We know about the red priestesses’ Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens’ Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god (will we ever see more Children of the Forest?), and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys wield a sword/arm/thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and/or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here. Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him/her/itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter. Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye. (Book Stuff again, yikes.) Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks. All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of ‘em before it’s too late. And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes?DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven (Maiden, Mother, Warrior, Stranger), and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God. And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of “All Along the Watchtower” cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell. And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid. Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy. This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters. I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy. If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire?I truly don’t know. Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply. Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is. I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either. My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide. After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.I haven’t thought much about the Starks’ future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician. I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war. The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms. And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert. A détente ensues. The years flash by. We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later. Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies. Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list. They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.“If you kill me,” Cersei says, “the country will descend into chaos.” The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya. And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten. “What’s more important,” Cersei asks Arya, “your vengeance or your country?”While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us. A country at peace… but maybe not for long.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/nWhat did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale?EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming. Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is “a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.” But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon?“I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind,” Headey said. “And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.”Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: “You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen. For a time. Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three. Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.”While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down. While we’re not touching that “more beautiful” bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow (er, Aegon Targaryen) and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead. “I think her lie will be very shocking,” Headey predicted. “She’s such a bitch. She’s so unforgiving of everybody.”Also check out Headey starring in a new Kasabian music video.Read our “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

In fact, following Sansa and Arya Stark’s epic bait and switch on Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish, the beloved HBO series’ very own Maisie Williams took to Twitter to share her thoughts on the explosive episode, and she summed it up rather perfectly.First, Williams, 20, retweeted a tweet she had posted in August 2016 instructing fans to begin emotionally readying themselves for season 7. Then she responded to herself with a classic J. Alexander GIF to encapsulate her pure and utter shock, simply captioning it: “U [were] so right.”U we're so right. #WinterIsHere pic.twitter.com/CBBsJX7bgp— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 28, 2017FROM COINAGE: The Cost of Visiting Game of Thrones‘ Westeros Of course, Williams wasn’t the only one weighing in on the finale.

See you next year!/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” We suspected it was coming. We were nearly certain. So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along. Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark. But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North. But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne. And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all. And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow. He’s Aegon Targaryen. Yes, we’re still getting used to that too. Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon (though we’re also not entirely sure what an Aegon looks like).The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty. Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen (unless his brother, the doomed infant Aegon,* is also counted).Jon (we’re going to keep using that name for now) and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season. And it raises some big questions:1. Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim? (Emilia Clarke has strong feelings about this in our post-finale interview).2. Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all. Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later. It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.3. Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens (Daenerys is the product of incest herself). But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4. Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous (she believes she can’t after her child with Drogo was stillborn, the witch cursed her and she “birthed” three dragons instead). Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate?5. Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords. Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if/when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir. One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a “foreigner” like Daenerys.6. How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes. Even her own brothers.7. And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season?More “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

— Game of Thrones podcast (finale episode coming Monday)* Confusing matters is the fact that Rhaegar had another son named Aegon with his previous wife Elia Martell. The infant Aegon, their other child, and Elia were all killed by Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegan during Robert’s Rebellion. These were the deaths that Prince Oberyn Martell was set on avenging during his all-too-brief time at King’s Landing before he was killed during a trial by combat.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish. The master of chaos, a climber of the ladders of power who finally reached for one rung too many. In trying to play Sansa and Arya Stark against one another (just as he once played their aunt Lysa against their mother Catelyn), the tactical manipulator laid bare his own villainy — especially with Bran Stark having access to all of space and time to probe his past. Littlefinger once aspired to reach the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. Now, like so many others who sought to rule, his life has been cut short — and by a woman he might have even truly loved.Below we spoke to Irish actor Aiden Gillan (The Wire, The Dark Knight Rises) about leaving the hit series after seven seasons of delivering a mesmerizing performance that humanized a character drawn with few redeeming qualities. The quiet, soft-spoken actor (I remember once finding him sitting quietly off by himself on the GoT set reading a David Foster Wallace book) doesn’t give interviews very often — Gillan generally prefers to let his performance speak for itself. And even during our chat he was reluctant to saying too much about his riveting final scene in Winterfell’s Great Hall lest his thoughts take something away from its impact. It’s perhaps the only trait Gillan shares with his nefarious character — he plays his cards close to his vest.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you get the infamous call?
AIDEN GILLAN: The infamous call. It’s so obvious what it is. [Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff] never ring you up — maybe once in six years. I learned about that call from [Roose Bolton actor Michael McElhatton] when he told me about his call and he talked about how it made him feel. And I thought if I get that call — or rather when as this has got to happen sooner or later to a character like Littlefinger — I wondered how it would make me feel. You start to think about because the show is such a part of your life for so many years. What will your life will be like outside of it? It’s a potent loss.So how did it make you feel?
You’re left a little bereft — for your character and for your experience. It also immediately makes you quantify the hugeness of what that experience has been over the last seven years, which has been massive.Did the showrunners joke around at all, or were they straightforward?
No joke. They just promised me a “river of blood.” Well, it wasn’t really a river of blood, but they promised me more than poor Michael got. It’s better to go out at the end of [the season] with a good arc then at the start of episode 2. Even if I’m only in a few episodes — like last season I probably had less than any season — once your character is established as part of the world people feel like you’re there all the time. So it’s not really an issue for me how many scenes I’m in as long as the scenes are good, and they’re well put together, and your contribution is good. Then people feel like you’re there al the time. I’m glad I had a good story to finish with.Littlefinger’s strategy in playing Arya against Sansa seemed really risky from the outset.
With carefully laid plans there’s always a bit of risk involved. He’s put himself in a situation that could backfire on him. I think he likes it. [His plans] are never fail safe. But he puts himself on the line like a good gambler.What was your reaction to the finale script?
Obviously, I was expecting it.But you didn’t know exactly how Littlefinger would go out, I assume.
Well, I did an interview with a publication [in 2015] and they asked me how I thought I would go. I said I thought Arya would deliver the blow. So it was as promised. And even within the scene, as soon as he walks in that room and Arya produces the dagger he knows the game is up. He at least suspected the game was up back in episode four when Bran told him, “Chaos is a ladder.” For Bran to come up with that is beyond coincidental. That’s when the ground started to shift beneath my feet. At that point, I knew the things I’ve done in private are not necessarily private.I haven’t seen your final scene but I’ve heard you’re fantastic in it, and that Littlefinger reveals some emotions that we haven’t really seen from him before. I don’t want to say too much about that. I don’t want to lay my cards on the table. I want to preserve that. There were more feelings for Sansa than I’ve let on the in the past. It becomes obvious. It’s an emotional farewell. And it’s a humiliating position to be in. He’s back in the sort of humiliating position that has been a driver for him: The rejection of Catelyn Stark, the humiliation by [Ned Stark’s older brother] Brandon Stark — back when he cut him from navel to collarbone and didn’t kill him [after their duel over Catelyn in their youth]. He’s put back in that position again.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game 0f Thrones What was your last day like?
My last day on the set wasn’t that scene. [The execution] was the second scene I shot. I quite enjoyed doing things that way — shooting [Littlefinger’s death] and then shooting what comes before. When you know what’s coming you relax a little in the way you interact with the others. There’s something else that seeps into your performance — a kind of serenity. But yeah, I did find it quite emotional [shooting the finale scene]. And I don’t necessarily mean that I was sad, but it’s an emotional moment for the character so I felt what he was feeling. For the real last day at work Dan and David weren’t there but [co-executive producer] Bryan Cogman called people in and said a few words and my son was there with me. That was quite something. And I got my mockingbird pin. I had already let them know I wanted it, and I cleverly worked it so I got two. There’s one from my cloak and one from my tunic. So I got the large and the small size — one for me and one for my son.Was your favorite scene that one where Littlefinger gives a speech threatening Ros? You’ve mentioned that one a few times before.
It’s one of my favorite scenes. It was a good establisher in season 2 and we learn more about him in that. There were others I’ve enjoyed as much — probably the scene with Sansa in the courtyard where I kissed her while talking about her mother; that’s where we start to see how this is all mixed up in his head. I’ve continued to try to bring a bit of warmth and affability to a character who is shadowy, villainous and even treacherous. I thought it was my job to try to make people like him.Ultimately one could say it’s better to be the climactic death of the season 7 finale than potentially one of several major events within the final season, right?
You know, I did pretty well. The character did pretty well. They need to hone [the cast] down. That’s not an issue, really. The end is when it happens. I don’t think beyond that.More “The Dragon and the Wolf ” coverage:

Emilia Clarke. How do you think Daenerys Targaryen is going to react in the final season of Game of Thrones to the rather stunning news that her lover Jon Snow is also her nephew?We asked the Game of Thrones star this question while she sat on folding chair amid the ancient Roman ruins of Italica outside Seville, Spain last fall. The production used the historical location for King’s Landing’s famed Dragonpit in Sunday’s emotional finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.”Clarke paused, considering. Then she loudly cried: “Ewwwww!” and laughed. “I think that’s how it’s going to go. I get the toothbrush—” she pretended to frantically brush her tongue.It was a hilarious reaction that underscores the rather seriously emotional game-changing revelation that threatens to shake up the final season of Game of Thrones.I pointed out that Daenerys has presumably long assumed she’ll avoid her family’s long predilection for incest. “Exactly!” Clarke says. “And then I walked back into it.”And what about the fact that Jon Snow — er, Aegon Targaryen — has a better claim to the Iron Throne than she does?“I’ve worked so hard, I don’t want to share that throne,” she replied. “No. The throne’s big enough for one dragon bum, and that’s mine. That’s it!”FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game of Thrones For costar Kit Harington, his main concern was figuring out how to realistically ramp up their romance with each of their pivotal scenes across four episodes — which led to some amusing behind the scenes debate.“Usually you go into a movie and meet [your costar] for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time,” Harington says. “But if you’ve known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we’re both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, ‘What’s the sexual tension in this scene?’ and she’s like, ‘Stop talking about sexual tension!’ It’s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.”Concurs Clarke: “Yeah [I would say], ‘Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don’t keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time,’” and added about the scene itself: “I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it’s a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.”The turning point for Daenerys, Clarke notes, was when Jon left her to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight. “She’s just like: Why don’t I want you do go? Why don’t I want you— doooooon’t fall for him. Don’t do it! There’s a battle going in on herself.”As for Harington’s reaction to his character’s parentage news next season, the actor would only say, “I said to Emilia it’s going to be a really cool scene when they find out.”And how will the reveal impact their relationship?“That part of it, I can’t predict,” he says. “It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other.”More “The Dragon and the Wolf ” coverage:

Kylie Jenner’s highly-anticipated reality spinoff show, Life of Kylie, has turned out to be a major flop and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the 20-year-old is blaming her own mother, Kris Jenner, for its failure!
After ratings showed that a meager 1.12 million people watched the KUWTK spinoff (which is half of the 2.08 million viewers that tuned in for Rob & Chyna’s reality) show, a source close to the Kardashian clan said, “Kylie is not taking this very well and she is putting the blame on everyone but herself!”
“She is blaming Kris for focusing more on Kim’s makeup launch than on her reality show and she is telling everyone in the family that it is not her fault that people are not interested in her show,” the insider said.

“The family was really hoping that Kylie’s show was going to save the Kardashian’s reality TV reign, not hurt their brand as it seems to have done. She is super distressed right now and is currently scrambling to shoot new material that will appeal to the audience,” the source told Radar.
“She is also blaming it on the editing team, which she says was hired by her mother and of course, she is blaming it on the time slot!”

As reported, Life of Kylie, is up against HBO’s hugely-successful smash hit show, Game of Thrones, which had more than 16 million viewers for its premiere episode.
But according to a rep for E!, the show already has broken a reality TV record!
“The series premiere of ‘Life of Kylie’ was the highest-rated new docuseries launch of 2017 with Women 18-34 and Teens P/W 12-17, and ranked #1 for the night in primetime with Adults 18-34 and Women 18-34 among ad-supported cable programs.”

George wants to add new neighbor Kit Harington to his A-list tribe — but the “Game of Thrones” hottie isn’t interested in joining Clooney’s clique!
A source told RadarOnline.com that since Kit — known for his role as Jon Snow — bought a Tudor-style home only miles from Clooney’s English country estate, Clooney has been begging the TV star to hang out — but to no avail!
“George has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire [England] and Lake Como [Italy] — but he’s in for disappointment,” a source told Radar. “Kit doesn’t want to be his new pal.”

The insider claims that although Harrington, 30, takes his career seriously, he has vowed never to become part of Hollywood’s “scene,” preferring to spend his downtime with girlfriend — and former “GOT” onscreen love — Rose Leslie, also 30.
“Kit’s mind is pretty made up. He doesn’t want to be George’s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It’s getting annoying!” the source squealed.
“[Kit’s home is] too far to take a boat, thank goodness — or else George would probably row by!”
