Game of Thrones Season 7 Finale: See the Best Celebrity Reactions!
What did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale? EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming.
Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.
But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon? I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind, Headey said.
And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.
Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: You’ll never wed the prince.
You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen.
For a time.
Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three.
Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.
While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down.
While we’re not touching that more beautiful bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.
FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead.
I think her lie will be very shocking, Headey predicted.
She’s such a bitch.
She’s so unforgiving of everybody.

During the seventh season of Game of Thrones, EW’s Darren Franich and Shirley Li have ventured into the weeds of Westeros every week to untangle the latest burning questions, ruminate over theories, and trace the show’s remaining connections to the unfinished books.
Consider this EW’s small council, made of two people far too obsessed with everything Thrones.
This year’s burning question: Besides the Great War, what will happen in season 8? SHIRLEY: Darren, here’s where we stand.
The Wall has fallen, and Tormund and Beric possiblywith it.
The Army of the Dead have Flappy Bird for a dragon and blue fire as their official interpretation of what a zombie dragon would breathe.
So the Great War is coming!But… that can’t be all there is to the final six episodes, can it? A series of extended battles, one after the next, between the Night King’s forces and those of Jon and Daenerys doesn’t sound like a very interesting way for this show to go out, does it? Other than the looming showdown up North, whatever Cersei’s planning down South appears to be the biggest question mark.
Not that it wasn’t logical for her to turn her back on even the most; the move felt like peak paranoid Cersei, who’s always been more interested in keeping control of her power over working for the greater good.
In fact, this finale gave Cersei a far bigger spotlight than I expected it would: She got to be the star of the Dragonpit stage, the con artist in her confrontation with Tyrion, and then grit her teeth as she nearly had the Mountain take out Jaime.
That’s a lot of time spent on a dead woman walking, and I can’t help but think that D&D have something larger in store for her next season.
That said, Darren, what do you think will be her next move? We spent all season underestimating her longevity, but now she’s sent Euron off to bring her the Golden Company and she’s turned her back on both of her brothers.
Once she has her sellswords and her elephants, what will she do? March on Winterfell for, I don’t know, fun and extra resources? And could Euron bring back more than what he set out to find? I’m sure Westeros has enjoyed all the attention lavished on it this year, but maybe we should start thinking about those players in Essos again.
DARREN: The strangest achievement of this very strange season is how utterly it rescrambled my loyalties as a viewer.
Next season, the remaining Starks will unite in Winterfell, and Jon’s Targaryen ancestry will come to light, and regular orange flame will mix with blue flame to create purple flame, maybe? And I would be totally happy if the season 8 premiere never leaves King’s Landing.
All Hail Queen Cersei, the only strategist left in Westeros! Bring on the Golden Company! March, elephants, march! Call her a cynic, call her a villain, but at least there’s still someone on this show with the foresight to worry about tomorrow’s war today.
I guess you could criticize Cersei for a lack of foresight.
The Army of the Dead will kill everyone, and therefore everyone must fight back.
We’ve heard this constantly: It’s a simple moral binary.
The fact that the Night King is commonly accepted as a climate-change metaphor seems to only deepen the sense of Cersei as a selfish evil.
But George R.
R.
Martin constructed his original story with the thrilling amorality of actual history.
And in that tradition, Cersei skipped the metaphors and did the math.
She’s got two enemies, essentially unstoppable.
One enemy is way up north and has an army of zombies.
Another enemy is going up north and has one less dragon than she used to.
Whoever wins, Cersei loses in the long-term.
Let the monsters kill each other is her gamble, and as gambles go, I think it’s a sharp one.
And I know some people will say, BUT THE NIGHT KING HAS AN UNDEAD DRAGON WHO COULD DESTROY KING’S LANDING TOMORROW! Good news on that front: Qyburn’s got a ballista, and there’s a certain island full of dragonglass not far from King’s Landing that is about to be vacated.
Plus, this gamble involves bringing in the Golden Company, a mercenary subculture that believes in kicking ass and conspicuous consumption.
The Golden Company haven’t appeared on the show yet, but they have an intriguing role in A Dance With Dragons.
In that book, they become the official muscle for a potential Iron Throne-sitter in a precarious position.
Holy crap, Shirley, what if Cersei is becoming Young Griff??? If that’s the case, her next move will be to shore up her dominance of the South.
Hell, since Cersei is so un-nostalgic that she left Casterly Rock empty, maybe she’ll even flee to a more defensible position, as far as possible from the Great War up north.
Does it even snow in Dorne? What do you think her next move is, Shirley? And how do you interpret the burgeoning, befuddling theory that she is somehow in cahoots with Tyrion? My hot take on That Tyrion Shot Everyone’s Talking About is that it means nothing.
But what do I know? I thought Littlefinger had a plan!SHIRLEY: I think what I’m struggling with when it comes to imagining an ending for all this is that I always thought it would be… bigger.
That sounds like an unfair assessment to make with a show that’s managed to deliver three dragon battles in one season, but I think I had expected this to be a far more complicated game than it’s turned out to be.
I’m glad you brought up Young Griff; that remains one of the plot points I wish the show had time to adapt.
Young Griff scrambled the pieces on the board late in the game, because we had a whole new series of questions to contend with: Is he really the supposedly dead Aegon, whisked away by Varys to be bred into the perfect Westerosi king? Is he a Blackfyre posing as a Targaryen? What will Dany think? In other words, I think what we lack is a proper wild card to raise the stakes further.
The dead is the enemy, sure, but let’s not forget the living.
Maybe in the show, that wild card will be the Golden Company, maybe it’ll be Melisandre and the red priestesses, or maybe D&D really is setting up Tyrion to be a final-act game-changer.
I know you’re not into the theory that Tyrion is working with Cersei now that she’s carrying a child, but I’m going to be watching him closely whenever the next season arrives.
It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead.
If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.
And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn.
She’ll be the undead wild card.
Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.
Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do.
But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind.
Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.
DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny.
Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory? I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei.
I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan.
And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula.
There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology.
Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.
I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama.
But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home.
Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell.
Such an event would unite several disparate story strands.
The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark.
The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell.
And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell.
I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements.
And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.
How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care? And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall / Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax? SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman as directors.
I want six movies.
I want at least one huge battle episode.
I want an episode told through flashbacks.
I want an end to deus ex machinas.
I want a Brienne-centric hour.
I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.
Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really.
I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.
Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith.
I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people.
The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season.
We know about the red priestesses Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god, and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.
After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys wield a sword / arm / thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here.
Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him / her / itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter.
Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.
But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye.
Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks.
All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of em before it’s too late.
And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes? DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven, and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God.
And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of All Along the Watchtower cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell.
And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid.
Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy.
This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters.
I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy.
If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire? I truly don’t know.
Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply.
Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is.
I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either.
My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide.
After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.
I haven’t thought much about the Starks future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician.
I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.
My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war.
The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms.
And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert.
A détente ensues.
The years flash by.
We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later.
Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies.
Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list.
They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.
If you kill me, Cersei says, the country will descend into chaos.
The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya.
And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten.
What’s more important, Cersei asks Arya, your vengeance or your country? While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us.
A country at peace… but maybe not for long.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
We suspected it was coming.
We were nearly certain.
So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along.
Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark.
But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.
Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North.
But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne.
And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all.
And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.
It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow.
He’s Aegon Targaryen.
Yes, we’re still getting used to that too.
Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon.
The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty.
Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen.
Jon and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season.
And it raises some big questions:1.
Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim?.
Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all.
Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later.
It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.
Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens.
But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4.
Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous.
Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate? 5.
Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords.
Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if / when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir.
One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a foreigner like Daenerys.
How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes.
Even her own brothers.
And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season? More The Dragon and the Wolf coverage:

These were the deaths that Prince Oberyn Martell was set on avenging during his all-too-brief time at King’s Landing before he was killed during a trial by combat.

Game of Thrones: Lena Headey Reveals What Cersei Really Thought of Daenerys

It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead.
If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.
And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn.
She’ll be the undead wild card.
Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.
Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do.
But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind.
Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.
DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny.
Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory? I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei.
I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan.
And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula.
There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology.
Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.
I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama.
But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home.
Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell.
Such an event would unite several disparate story strands.
The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark.
The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell.
And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell.
I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements.
And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.
How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care? And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall / Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax? SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman as directors.
I want six movies.
I want at least one huge battle episode.
I want an episode told through flashbacks.
I want an end to deus ex machinas.
I want a Brienne-centric hour.
I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.
Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really.
I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.
Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith.
I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people.
The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season.
We know about the red priestesses Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god, and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.
After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys wield a sword / arm / thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here.
Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him / her / itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter.
Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.
But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye.
Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks.
All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of em before it’s too late.
And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes? DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven, and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God.
And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of All Along the Watchtower cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell.
And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid.
Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy.
This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters.
I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy.
If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire? I truly don’t know.
Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply.
Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is.
I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either.
My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide.
After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.
I haven’t thought much about the Starks future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician.
I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.
My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war.
The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms.
And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert.
A détente ensues.
The years flash by.
We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later.
Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies.
Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list.
They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.
If you kill me, Cersei says, the country will descend into chaos.
The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya.
And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten.
What’s more important, Cersei asks Arya, your vengeance or your country? While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us.
A country at peace… but maybe not for long.

What did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale? EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming.
Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.
But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon? I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind, Headey said.
And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.
Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: You’ll never wed the prince.
You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen.
For a time.
Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three.
Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.
While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down.
While we’re not touching that more beautiful bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.
FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead.
I think her lie will be very shocking, Headey predicted.
She’s such a bitch.
She’s so unforgiving of everybody.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
After months of mounting anticipation and intense fan theorizing, the Game of Thrones season 7 finale has come and gone Happy tweeting, Thrones fans.
See you next year!
WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
We suspected it was coming.
We were nearly certain.
So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along.
Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark.
But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.
Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North.
But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne.
And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all.
And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.
It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow.
He’s Aegon Targaryen.
Yes, we’re still getting used to that too.
Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon.
The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty.
Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen.
Jon and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season.
And it raises some big questions:1.
Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim?.
Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all.
Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later.
It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.
Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens.
But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4.
Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous.
Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate? 5.
Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords.
Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if / when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir.
One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a foreigner like Daenerys.
How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes.
Even her own brothers.
And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season? More The Dragon and the Wolf coverage:

How That Jon Snow Twist on Game of Thrones Changes Everything
This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup.
Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.
Related: There's Sexy Jon Snow Halloween Costume…
Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan.
Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself! 
Queen vs.
Queen vs.
King
Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north.
Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons.
We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister.
But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co.
could see for themselves that wights are indeed real.
Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish
Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn.
As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters.
Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was trying to use her.
Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason.
In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble.
It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat.
Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode.
Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

The Game of Thrones season seven finale was satisfying for many reasons, but none more than the episode's title teased us about.
After uniting the Houses together to fight against the army of the dead, Fire finally laid with Ice.
The Dragon danced with the wolf.
Daenerys Targaryen climbed Mt.
Jon Snow, and he in return took a plunge into her dragon pit — and it was GLORIOUS.
Not as glorious, however, when considering that Westeros hottest love scene played out while fans were reminded that the two characters are actually aunt and nephew!
Related: Twitter Reacts To Game Of Thrones Finale!!
Though fans may have made peace with the fact that Jon and Dany are secretly related, the characters have a lot to be nauseated about.
At least, that's what Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington teased would be the response after the Targaryen truth bomb gets dropped in season eight.
Speaking to EW, Clarke considered her character's reaction to the news that she was fucking her own fire and blood, laughing: 
Ewwwww! I think that's how it's going to go.
I get the toothbrush—
Well, we can't really blame her, can we? Especially given the fact that Jon Snow's true identity — Aegon Targaryen — now threatens Dany's claim to the Iron Throne.
In the finale, it was revealed that Jon / Aegon's parents Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were secretly married, making him the true heir to rule Westeros.
According to Clarke, that's going to put quite the spike in the new relationship — because Dany ain't about to share:
I've worked so hard, I don't want to share that throne.
No.
The throne's big enough for one dragon bum, and that's mine.
That's it!
Loverboy Harington wasn't as concerned with the impending doom of Jon and Dany as for how to realistically ramp up their chemistry during their short time together over the past four episodes.
Related: Trump Administration — As GoT Characters!
Speaking on the pressure to play out the biggest romance of the series, he explained:
Usually you go into a movie and meet your costar for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time.
But if you've known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we're both kind of freaking out about it.
I would be like, What's the sexual tension in this scene? and she's like, Stop talking about sexual tension! It's a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.
Clarke had more confidence in their palpable chemistry, adding:
Yeah I would say, Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don't keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time… I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it's a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.
Yep! Clark notes the big realization for Dany was when Jon left Dragonstone to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight:
She's just like: Why don't I want you do go? Why don't I want you— doooooon't fall for him.
Don't do it! There's a battle going in on herself.
As for Jon's reaction to learning who he truly is — and who he's truly banging — Harington would only say:
I said to Emilia it's going to be a really cool scene when they find out.
But as for what they'll do after they find out, only the writers know! He added:
That part of it, I can't predict.
It could be them walking off into the sunset.
It could be them killing each other.
Seeing as this is Game of Thrones, we already know which tragic end to expect.
So let's enjoy the ride while we still can — we know Jon and Dany sure are!
This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup.
Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.

Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan.
Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself! 
Queen vs.
Queen vs.
King
Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north.
Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons.
We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister.
But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co.
could see for themselves that wights are indeed real.
Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish
Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn.
As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters.
Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was trying to use her.
Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason.
In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble.
It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat.
Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode.
Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

Newly-released footage from a Utah police officer's body camera shows University Hospital nurse, Alex Wubbels, screaming as she was forcefully arrested for refusing to illegally draw blood from an unconscious patient.

In the beginning of the video, Wubbels is seen calmly explaining that the car accident victim was required to give consent for a blood sample, be under arrest, or there needed to be a warrant.
Since none of those things were applicable, Wubbels could not give Salt Lake detective Jeff Payne what he was looking for.
What happens next is truly disturbing.

Twitter Had Quite A Bit To Say During The Game Of Thrones Season Seven Finale!!
Disturbing Video Shows Utah Police Forcefully Arresting Nurse Who Refused To Allow Illegal Blood Sample
Season seven has been Game Of Thrones most watched ever — but also possibly its most panned.
Longtime fans have criticized the shorter season for inconsistent character moments, rushed plotlines, and logic problems.
It's been said the show is losing its edge as writers, no longer able to lean on the books, aren't sure where to go.

On Sunday night, even another cable network took a swipe at the show.

I.
P.
to the show: 
But Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon wants fans to know he his show is NOT down with that shade.
In fact, he released an epic takedown of the anonymous writer's lazy, craftless jab at the WRITING on my favorite show.
See what he had to say about the unearned snark!
A post shared by Dan Harmon on Aug 30, 2017 at 4:06pm PDT
Damn, Dan, that is a RANT! Next!
SPOILERS AHEAD
But come on, it was like four days ago!
It's been half a week since the Game Of Thrones finale, and fans are still trying to unpack everything that happened — and knowing the show won't be back until 2019, they're in no rush to be done.
Amid the dread over the coming White Walkers and weird feelings about Jon and Dany's… relations… there was one moment of pure delight — seeing Sansa and Arya FINALLY turn the tables and take out master manipulator Peter Baelish.
Related: Full Recap Of The Dragon And The Wolf HERE!
After several episodes in which Littlefinger attempted to drive a wedge between the very different Stark sisters, they finally realized what was up and brought his machinations to light in front of an audience — before cutting his throat with the same knife he sent to kill Bran way back in season one.
But the show took its time getting to that bloody resolution; the last time we saw the sisters together, Arya was literally threatening to kill Sansa and wear her face.
So what happened??
The theory put forth by fans confused by scary Arya was that she and Sansa were play acting the whole time, just pretending to want to kill each other for the benefit of Littlefinger's spying.
The long con theory was confirmed by the finale twist, right? Actually, a deleted scene changes the context of that final confrontation and the family face offs beforehand.
In an interview with Variety, Bran actor Isaac Hempstead-Wright explained:
We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran's door and says, I need your help, or something along those lines.
So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister.
So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she's like, Oh, shit.
'
The existence of that scene proves that Sansa and Arya were NOT plotting against Littlefinger the whole time but rather they needed to finally talk to their creepy Three-Eyed Raven bro to get their heads on straight.
VOTE: Who Do YOU Think Will Win The Iron Throne?? 
We're actually glad that scene was cut — sorry, Peter, deleted — because then we would have seen the twist coming.
And it was so much sweeter to get the surprise.
Also, we prefer the fan theory.
The sisters being too clever, even without magic eyes, is such a strong message.
Man, there were some big changes on the season 7 finale of Game Of Thrones!
SPOILERS
Jon Snow is actually Aegon Targaryen, the rightful heir.
Cersei is planning on stabbing everyone in the back.
Sansa is now the shrewdest of them all.
Related: Emilia Clarke & Kit Harington React To That Game Of Thrones Sex Scene: Ewwwww!'
Oh, and the Night King is riding his undead dragon south of the wall with an army of wights at his back.
So after all that, have your predictions changed? Who do YOU think will sit the Iron Throne when all this is over??
Vote! 
The Game of Thrones season seven finale was satisfying for many reasons, but none more than the episode's title teased us about.
After uniting the Houses together to fight against the army of the dead, Fire finally laid with Ice.
The Dragon danced with the wolf.
Daenerys Targaryen climbed Mt.
Jon Snow, and he in return took a plunge into her dragon pit — and it was GLORIOUS.
Not as glorious, however, when considering that Westeros hottest love scene played out while fans were reminded that the two characters are actually aunt and nephew!
Related: Twitter Reacts To Game Of Thrones Finale!!
Though fans may have made peace with the fact that Jon and Dany are secretly related, the characters have a lot to be nauseated about.
At least, that's what Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington teased would be the response after the Targaryen truth bomb gets dropped in season eight.
Speaking to EW, Clarke considered her character's reaction to the news that she was fucking her own fire and blood, laughing: 
Ewwwww! I think that's how it's going to go.
I get the toothbrush—
Well, we can't really blame her, can we? Especially given the fact that Jon Snow's true identity — Aegon Targaryen — now threatens Dany's claim to the Iron Throne.
In the finale, it was revealed that Jon / Aegon's parents Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were secretly married, making him the true heir to rule Westeros.
According to Clarke, that's going to put quite the spike in the new relationship — because Dany ain't about to share:
I've worked so hard, I don't want to share that throne.
No.
The throne's big enough for one dragon bum, and that's mine.
That's it!
Loverboy Harington wasn't as concerned with the impending doom of Jon and Dany as for how to realistically ramp up their chemistry during their short time together over the past four episodes.
Related: Trump Administration — As GoT Characters!
Speaking on the pressure to play out the biggest romance of the series, he explained:
Usually you go into a movie and meet your costar for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time.
But if you've known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we're both kind of freaking out about it.
I would be like, What's the sexual tension in this scene? and she's like, Stop talking about sexual tension! It's a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.

The guy who played Dickon Tarly on Game of Thrones ain't bothered by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen's incest in the finale, cause it was inevitable.
We got Tom Hopper at LAX - but before we got to Jon and Dany, we had to know, why no shirtless scenes from his buff character before meeting his fate, courtesy of dragon's breath.
Tom has an explanation for that, and also some thoughts on why the King of the North and the Dragon Queen hooking up isn't that big of a deal, even if she's his aunt.
His theory has more to do with the plot leading up to that big reveal, but still, Tom seems down.

The Game hired a burger joint to cater his shindig, but went radio silent when it came time to pay the piper, so says the owner suing the rapper, but Game says the owner's lying her ass off.
The owner of Big D's Burgers sued Game claiming the joint is out $8,500 for unpaid catering services for a Fourth of July party.
A rep for Big D's tells us Game hired the restaurant on 2 separate occasions and each time Game paid cash.
The rep says Game requested food for up to 250 partygoers.
But the rep says about 450 people showed up, forcing Big D's to make a food run.
What's more, the rep says he was told to also grab booze and cleaning supplies, which wasn't part of the deal but agreed to buy and bring back anyway.
When it came time to pay Big D's, the rep says Game promised to wire the money the next day, but the dough never came.
We reached out to Game, and his manager Wack 100 tells TMZ the rapper never had a contract with Big D's and says they thought the company catered the party for free.
WHO'S THE ROOKIE NOW?! Von Miller got smashed on by rookie lineman Garett Bolles in a competitive game of mini-basketball in the Broncos locker room, with Bolles tearing the rim down in the process!

I-N-O acknowledges it didn't specifically trademark the name Triple Double - although it claims its patrons are known to customize orders with similar terms.
But in the suit, it says Smash's move is causing confusion in the marketplace and screwing with their burger biz.
We've reached out to Smash for comment, so far, no word back.
Ezekiel Elliott's date with the arbitrator is here - the Dallas Cowboys running back is set to appear at NFL headquarters in NYC Tuesday to appeal his 6 game domestic violence suspension.
Elliott has adamantly denied physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson, despite the results of the NFL's private investigation into the matter.
Elliott will plead his case to arbitrator Harold Henderson  - the same arbitrator who heard Adrian Peterson's appeal in his child abuse suspension and Greg Hardy's appeal in his domestic violence suspension.
FYI, Henderson shot down Peterson's appeal - but reduced Hardy's suspension from 10 games to 4.
Elliott will be represented by Jeffrey Kessler  - the same guy who repped Tom Brady in the DeflateGate appeal.
Kessler got the initial 4 game suspension overturned in arbitration before the NFL went to court and had the suspension reinstated.
If Elliott's suspension is upheld, it's not the end of the road for the RB - he's expected to continue the fight by filing a lawsuit in federal court.

Tom has an explanation for that, and also some thoughts on why the King of the North and the Dragon Queen hooking up isn't that big of a deal, even if she's his aunt.

Did Aaron Carter Have a Mental Breakdown Over Breakup on Twitter?
Yikes!
Aaron Carter was arrested in Georgia Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence, pot possession, and obstruction of law enforcement officers.
The singer was charged with three misdemeanors — DUI, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, and possession of drug-related objects — after he was taken in custody on Saturday, according to police records.
His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was also arrested for alleged drug-related offenses.
Carter’s bail was set at $4,610, while Parker’s was set at $4,360.
They reportedly posted bail Sunday afternoon.
Soon after his arrest, the 29-year-old took to social media to slam his older brother, Nick Carter, who publicly reached out to Aaron when he heard the news of his DUI.
To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better, Nick tweeted.
Family isn’t always easy, be we’re all here for you.
To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better.
Family isn’t always easy,be we’re all here for you.
If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum? That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down, Aaron retorted.
I love my family despite it through thick and thin.
Nick appeared to respond to his younger sibling by retweeting a note from sister Lauren Kitt Carter, reading, Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!
Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!
In a statement released my Aaron, he alleged he was targeted by the police because of his celebrity.
He also claimed he was  not in the vehicle at the time of his arrest, and was denied a right to an attorney when authorities booked him.
Aaron’s been traveling non-stop doing promotions on his latest hit single Sooner or Later across the southeast when his automobile had a new tire put on it and it went out of alignment, the statement read.
Aaron drove the vehicle to the nearest Auto Zone in Cornelia, Georgia.
After being at the store and requesting help to get his alignment fixed, he was arrested inside by several police officers with aggression.
The police also revoked his rights to have an attorney.
The statement continued, Aaron holds a medical license for medical marijuana for his long standing anxiety.
He feels his celebrity was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter.
The video from Auto Zone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.
Thank you ALL for your prayers & well wishes.
I am so sorry to all my fans that I missed.
The truth will come out! Read my statement here:

Sources told The National ENQUIRER that since Kit — known for his role as Jon Snow — bought a Tudor-style home only miles from George’s English country estate, George has been begging the TV star to hang out — but to no avail! George has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire England and Lake Como Italy — but he’s in for disappointment, a tipster snitched to ATB.
Kit doesn’t want to be his new pal.
The insider disclosed that although Kit, 30, takes his career seriously, he has vowed never to become part of Hollywood’s scene, preferring to spend his downtime with girlfriend — and former GoT onscreen love — Rose Leslie, also 30.
Kit’s mind is pretty made up.

'Game Of Thrones Fans Rejoice! Sansa & Arya Stark Take On Carpool Karaoke
During the seventh season of Game of Thrones, EW’s Darren Franich and Shirley Li have ventured into the weeds of Westeros every week to untangle the latest burning questions, ruminate over theories, and trace the show’s remaining connections to the unfinished books.
Consider this EW’s small council, made of two people far too obsessed with everything Thrones.
This year’s burning question: Besides the Great War, what will happen in season 8? SHIRLEY: Darren, here’s where we stand.
The Wall has fallen, and Tormund and Beric possiblywith it.
The Army of the Dead have Flappy Bird for a dragon and blue fire as their official interpretation of what a zombie dragon would breathe.
So the Great War is coming!But… that can’t be all there is to the final six episodes, can it? A series of extended battles, one after the next, between the Night King’s forces and those of Jon and Daenerys doesn’t sound like a very interesting way for this show to go out, does it? Other than the looming showdown up North, whatever Cersei’s planning down South appears to be the biggest question mark.
Not that it wasn’t logical for her to turn her back on even the most; the move felt like peak paranoid Cersei, who’s always been more interested in keeping control of her power over working for the greater good.
In fact, this finale gave Cersei a far bigger spotlight than I expected it would: She got to be the star of the Dragonpit stage, the con artist in her confrontation with Tyrion, and then grit her teeth as she nearly had the Mountain take out Jaime.
That’s a lot of time spent on a dead woman walking, and I can’t help but think that D&D have something larger in store for her next season.
That said, Darren, what do you think will be her next move? We spent all season underestimating her longevity, but now she’s sent Euron off to bring her the Golden Company and she’s turned her back on both of her brothers.
Once she has her sellswords and her elephants, what will she do? March on Winterfell for, I don’t know, fun and extra resources? And could Euron bring back more than what he set out to find? I’m sure Westeros has enjoyed all the attention lavished on it this year, but maybe we should start thinking about those players in Essos again.
DARREN: The strangest achievement of this very strange season is how utterly it rescrambled my loyalties as a viewer.
Next season, the remaining Starks will unite in Winterfell, and Jon’s Targaryen ancestry will come to light, and regular orange flame will mix with blue flame to create purple flame, maybe? And I would be totally happy if the season 8 premiere never leaves King’s Landing.
All Hail Queen Cersei, the only strategist left in Westeros! Bring on the Golden Company! March, elephants, march! Call her a cynic, call her a villain, but at least there’s still someone on this show with the foresight to worry about tomorrow’s war today.
I guess you could criticize Cersei for a lack of foresight.
The Army of the Dead will kill everyone, and therefore everyone must fight back.
We’ve heard this constantly: It’s a simple moral binary.
The fact that the Night King is commonly accepted as a climate-change metaphor seems to only deepen the sense of Cersei as a selfish evil.
But George R.
R.
Martin constructed his original story with the thrilling amorality of actual history.
And in that tradition, Cersei skipped the metaphors and did the math.
She’s got two enemies, essentially unstoppable.
One enemy is way up north and has an army of zombies.
Another enemy is going up north and has one less dragon than she used to.
Whoever wins, Cersei loses in the long-term.
Let the monsters kill each other is her gamble, and as gambles go, I think it’s a sharp one.
And I know some people will say, BUT THE NIGHT KING HAS AN UNDEAD DRAGON WHO COULD DESTROY KING’S LANDING TOMORROW! Good news on that front: Qyburn’s got a ballista, and there’s a certain island full of dragonglass not far from King’s Landing that is about to be vacated.
Plus, this gamble involves bringing in the Golden Company, a mercenary subculture that believes in kicking ass and conspicuous consumption.
The Golden Company haven’t appeared on the show yet, but they have an intriguing role in A Dance With Dragons.
In that book, they become the official muscle for a potential Iron Throne-sitter in a precarious position.
Holy crap, Shirley, what if Cersei is becoming Young Griff??? If that’s the case, her next move will be to shore up her dominance of the South.
Hell, since Cersei is so un-nostalgic that she left Casterly Rock empty, maybe she’ll even flee to a more defensible position, as far as possible from the Great War up north.
Does it even snow in Dorne? What do you think her next move is, Shirley? And how do you interpret the burgeoning, befuddling theory that she is somehow in cahoots with Tyrion? My hot take on That Tyrion Shot Everyone’s Talking About is that it means nothing.
But what do I know? I thought Littlefinger had a plan!SHIRLEY: I think what I’m struggling with when it comes to imagining an ending for all this is that I always thought it would be… bigger.
That sounds like an unfair assessment to make with a show that’s managed to deliver three dragon battles in one season, but I think I had expected this to be a far more complicated game than it’s turned out to be.
I’m glad you brought up Young Griff; that remains one of the plot points I wish the show had time to adapt.
Young Griff scrambled the pieces on the board late in the game, because we had a whole new series of questions to contend with: Is he really the supposedly dead Aegon, whisked away by Varys to be bred into the perfect Westerosi king? Is he a Blackfyre posing as a Targaryen? What will Dany think? In other words, I think what we lack is a proper wild card to raise the stakes further.
The dead is the enemy, sure, but let’s not forget the living.
Maybe in the show, that wild card will be the Golden Company, maybe it’ll be Melisandre and the red priestesses, or maybe D&D really is setting up Tyrion to be a final-act game-changer.
I know you’re not into the theory that Tyrion is working with Cersei now that she’s carrying a child, but I’m going to be watching him closely whenever the next season arrives.
It does make the most sense that he’s simply wary of twue wuv entering the Jon-Dany alliance, but maybe the existential crisis they’ve all been in since seeing the wight has driven him to think several dark steps ahead.
If Daenerys falls, where would Tyrion go? And if Daenerys begins making rash decisions because of her love for Jon, might Tyrion go for the lesser of two mad queens? Would he and Varys jump ship? At the very least, it’s a theory I like better than the one about Tyrion possibly being in love with Daenerys.
And now, I’m going to toss out an insane theory of my own: Cersei’s next move is to die — and then be raised from the dead by Qyburn.
She’ll be the undead wild card.
Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, but this time, it’s Jon and Dany caught in the middle, not Cersei herself.
Then again, I thought she’d die this season, so obviously I know as little as you do.
But what do you think, Darren? Does it bother you as much as it does me that we’re probably heading toward a tidier ending than the one set up in the books? And what of Winterfell? With the Starks in full control but winter descending heavily onto the castle, should we be expecting them to move elsewhere next season? Bran, I imagine, will stay behind.
Three Eyed Ravens have no need for warmer climates.
DARREN: If we talk too much about Young Griff then I’ll wind up talking about my poor beloved Quentyn Martell, fortune’s fool, the pointless prince, a whole subplot about the dangers of believing that the world has room for destiny.
Not to linger too long in Book Stuff Most Normals Don’t Worry About, but didn’t Jon Snow kind of BECOME Quentyn Martell this season, a far-traveling royal seeking alliance with Queen Dany? Isn’t it weird how the show suggested that, yep, there is a place in this world for attractive young lovers seeking righteous world-saving glory? I love everything you’re saying about Tyrion and Cersei.
I love the idea that Tyrion actually learned some lessons from this season: That, if nothing else, it’s good to have a back-up plan.
And I love the idea that Qyburn will study the wights and come up with his own death-defeating synth-zombie formula.
There’s a counter-read on the recent years of the show that Qyburn is some sort of necessary Westerosi evil, a provocative progressive scientist inventing late-Medieval technology.
Maybe I’m entering the late-nihilist phase of my Thrones fandom, but I like the idea that Tyrion and Cersei could wind up saving their family after a lifetime spent tearing it apart.
I buy that sibling drama even less than I bought this season’s Winterfell sibling drama.
But what a joy, to see Sansa and Arya united, just like they were already united a few episodes ago before the raven-hacking scandal! I don’t think they’ll depart their ancestral home.
Actually, I’ve always imagined that some final momentous battle with the Night King will happen at Winterfell.
Such an event would unite several disparate story strands.
The suggestion that the Night King is a Stark.
The book-ending fact that Thrones began at Winterfell.
And consider this possibility: Someone could sum up the victory against the Army of the Dead with the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell.
I’m thrill-drunk just imagining the scene where Arya and Jon go all Legolas-and-Gimli on the Winterfell battlements.
And I’m almost tearful, imagining a fled-north Jaime guarding Bran in the tower where their problems began.
How do you think the story proceeds up North next season, Shirley? What do you think the reaction to Jon’s Targaryen news will be? Will Dany and Jon even care? And, thinking broader: What do you want to see in season 8? What will feel appropriate in a six-episode season? Do you want six one-hour movies, Marshall / Sapochnik style? Are we trending toward a climax, or a purposeful anticlimax? SHIRLEY: I want Sapochnik, MacLaren, Bender, and Shakman as directors.
I want six movies.
I want at least one huge battle episode.
I want an episode told through flashbacks.
I want an end to deus ex machinas.
I want a Brienne-centric hour.
I want to know if Ser Pounce is doing alright.
Okay, so I’m not sure what I want, really.
I am hoping, however, that we won’t spend the entire season on the Great War; the Night King should perish and his army disintegrate sooner rather than later, because I don’t think the ultimate message of this series is that the living can conquer the dead.
Instead, I think we’re headed toward something surrounding faith.
I like your idea of Winterfell as the final location, and not just because I gasped at the phrase Winter fell at Winterfell — I’m equally impressed and infuriated, Darren! — but also because the North has been established as the only kingdom where the old gods still matter to its people.
The series has woven the idea of different beliefs throughout the seasons, and though you could argue it was all for world-building and not for the series endgame, I have a feeling something spiritually abstract could be in store in the final season.
We know about the red priestesses Lord of Light, the Faceless Mens Many-Faced God, the Ironborn’s Drowned God, the North’s old god, and pretty much everyone else’s Faith of the Seven, and I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of how closely religious themes in the books — oops, back to Book Stuff — has been tied to prophecies about our two leads.
After all, we’ve discussed the significance of Azor Ahai before, but to what end? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys wield a sword / arm / thingy of fire? Will we see Jon and / or Daenerys murder the other to light it, as the story goes? Is that where we’re headed with the two of them, as the final season will have to reveal their familial connection? My point is: I think Dany and Jon will care because the plot dictates it, and because there’s something bigger at work here.
Now I’m starting to think the final season will go all Battlestar Galactica and involve some wonky philosophical material that ends in — eight-year-old spoiler alert! — them beginning New Life, while one of the leads sacrifices him / her / itself by venturing into, I don’t know, the Land of Always Winter.
Yeah, this isn’t making a lot of sense.
But look, the first war in Westeros ended with a pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men at God’s Eye.
Could the Great War end not in conflict but with another pact? Could a higher power get involved? Who knows! Earlier this season, I thought we would transcend politics, and here we are, with Cersei intact! So tell me, Darren, am I going a little nuts and thinking too broadly now? I realize I didn’t even think about what’ll happen specifically with the Starks.
All I know is we’ve gotta reunite all of em before it’s too late.
And what are your kookiest theories for these remaining episodes? DARREN: I am here for your wonky philoso-spiritual final act! Perhaps we are building to a meeting between envoys from all the godly abstractions: the Lord of Light speaking through Melisandre, Arya as the unsuspecting envoy for the Many-Faced God, Three-Eyed Bran representing the Northern deities, Cersei the incarnation of at least Four of the Seven, and good old Theon Greyjoy representing for the Drowned God.
And maybe when they meet, the ethereal sounds of All Along the Watchtower cascade downward through the corridors of Winterfell.
And then Ygritte flies down and says she knows where Earth is!I kid, but I don’t kid.
Like the books, the show started off in a realm of near-realistic Medieval Fantasy.
This season jumped all-the-way into the realm of magical monsters, but you’re right to point out how it also kept circling around the various deities worshipped by the characters.
I’d love if the last sequence of episodes pushes further into the realm of Weird Fantasy.
If they defeat the Night King, does that also somehow alter the curious Westerosi climate – ending winter itself, or at least resetting the seasonal schedule to something more familiar to us regular earthlings? Is THAT the New World that Dany will create after she breaks the wheel – not just a new set of Seven Kingdoms ruled by her benevolent hand, but a whole new Westeros, reshaped and terraformed by the clash of ice and fire? I truly don’t know.
Benioff & Weiss have always seemed hesitant, maybe understandably, to explore the supernatural stuff too deeply.
Two people separately told Bran this season that they have no idea what the Three-Eyed Raven is.
I assume that’s some teasing confession from the showrunners; and hell, it’s not like I really get it, either.
My personal prediction is that the Great War will be an all-time TV smash-up, a Sapochnik-ian battle epic rife with main-character death and dragoncide.
After that, we’ll have an episode – or maybe a couple episodes – of eerie, ambiguous, MacLaren-esque anticlimax, with the future of Westeros plotted in the shadows.
I haven’t thought much about the Starks future, but I have high hopes that Sansa remains the Lady in Winterfell: Arya kerfuffle aside, I remain enamored with her journey these last couple of seasons, and the implication that she has learned harsh lessons from awful people and come out the other side a more clever kind of Stark, as noble as her father but a much more cunning politician.
I doubt Jon will wind up sitting on any throne, and I wonder if the Red God’s resurrection magic was a shorter-term fix than we realize.
My boldest and possibly dumbest theory: After the Great War comes the cold war.
The tattered forces up North turn south and discover that Queen Cersei has laid claim to the other six kingdoms.
And in a shocking twist, Cersei is a popular Queen: A force of order in a land that’s fallen into constant chaos ever since the death of King Robert.
A détente ensues.
The years flash by.
We pick up with Cersei and little Tywin Lannister II in the Red Keep, some years later.
Tywin 2 runs outside to pull the wings off of butterflies.
Out of the shadows steps Arya, planning to cross out that one final name from her list.
They’re alone in her room together, the Queen and her hopeful assassin.
If you kill me, Cersei says, the country will descend into chaos.
The North and South will go to war, she tells Arya.
And worse: Bannerman will turn on each other, treaties only recently signed will be forgotten.
What’s more important, Cersei asks Arya, your vengeance or your country? While Arya ponders this, and perhaps ponders the meaning of everything in her life since the day the direwolves came home, we pull away through Cersei’s window, into the sky above King’s Landing, skyrocketing upwards until we can see all of Westeros spread out beneath us.
A country at peace… but maybe not for long.

What did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale? EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming.
Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.
But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon? I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind, Headey said.
And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.
Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: You’ll never wed the prince.
You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen.
For a time.
Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three.
Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.
While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down.
While we’re not touching that more beautiful bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.
FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead.
I think her lie will be very shocking, Headey predicted.
She’s such a bitch.
She’s so unforgiving of everybody.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
After months of mounting anticipation and intense fan theorizing, the Game of Thrones season 7 finale has come and gone Happy tweeting, Thrones fans.
See you next year!
WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
We suspected it was coming.
We were nearly certain.
So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along.
Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark.
But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.
Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North.
But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne.
And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all.
And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.
It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow.
He’s Aegon Targaryen.
Yes, we’re still getting used to that too.
Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon.
The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty.
Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen.
Jon and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season.
And it raises some big questions:1.
Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim?.
Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all.
Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later.
It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.
Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens.
But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4.
Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous.
Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate? 5.
Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords.
Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if / when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir.
One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a foreigner like Daenerys.
How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes.
Even her own brothers.
And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season? More The Dragon and the Wolf coverage:

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
The master of chaos, a climber of the ladders of power who finally reached for one rung too many.
In trying to play Sansa and Arya Stark against one another, the tactical manipulator laid bare his own villainy — especially with Bran Stark having access to all of space and time to probe his past.
Littlefinger once aspired to reach the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side.
Now, like so many others who sought to rule, his life has been cut short — and by a woman he might have even truly loved.
Below we spoke to Irish actor Aiden Gillan about leaving the hit series after seven seasons of delivering a mesmerizing performance that humanized a character drawn with few redeeming qualities.
The quiet, soft-spoken actor doesn’t give interviews very often — Gillan generally prefers to let his performance speak for itself.
And even during our chat he was reluctant to saying too much about his riveting final scene in Winterfell’s Great Hall lest his thoughts take something away from its impact.
It’s perhaps the only trait Gillan shares with his nefarious character — he plays his cards close to his vest.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you get the infamous call?
AIDEN GILLAN: The infamous call.
It’s so obvious what it is.
Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff never ring you up — maybe once in six years.
I learned about that call from Roose Bolton actor Michael McElhatton when he told me about his call and he talked about how it made him feel.
And I thought if I get that call — or rather when as this has got to happen sooner or later to a character like Littlefinger — I wondered how it would make me feel.
You start to think about because the show is such a part of your life for so many years.
What will your life will be like outside of it? It’s a potent loss.
So how did it make you feel?
You’re left a little bereft — for your character and for your experience.
It also immediately makes you quantify the hugeness of what that experience has been over the last seven years, which has been massive.
Did the showrunners joke around at all, or were they straightforward?
No joke.
They just promised me a river of blood.
Well, it wasn’t really a river of blood, but they promised me more than poor Michael got.
It’s better to go out at the end of the season with a good arc then at the start of episode 2.
Even if I’m only in a few episodes — like last season I probably had less than any season — once your character is established as part of the world people feel like you’re there all the time.
So it’s not really an issue for me how many scenes I’m in as long as the scenes are good, and they’re well put together, and your contribution is good.
Then people feel like you’re there al the time.
I’m glad I had a good story to finish with.
Littlefinger’s strategy in playing Arya against Sansa seemed really risky from the outset.
With carefully laid plans there’s always a bit of risk involved.
He’s put himself in a situation that could backfire on him.
I think he likes it.
His plans are never fail safe.
But he puts himself on the line like a good gambler.
What was your reaction to the finale script?
Obviously, I was expecting it.
But you didn’t know exactly how Littlefinger would go out, I assume.
Well, I did an interview with a publication in 2015 and they asked me how I thought I would go.
I said I thought Arya would deliver the blow.
So it was as promised.
And even within the scene, as soon as he walks in that room and Arya produces the dagger he knows the game is up.
He at least suspected the game was up back in episode four when Bran told him, Chaos is a ladder.
For Bran to come up with that is beyond coincidental.
That’s when the ground started to shift beneath my feet.
At that point, I knew the things I’ve done in private are not necessarily private.
I haven’t seen your final scene but I’ve heard you’re fantastic in it, and that Littlefinger reveals some emotions that we haven’t really seen from him before.
I don’t want to say too much about that.
I don’t want to lay my cards on the table.
I want to preserve that.
There were more feelings for Sansa than I’ve let on the in the past.
It becomes obvious.
It’s an emotional farewell.
And it’s a humiliating position to be in.
He’s back in the sort of humiliating position that has been a driver for him: The rejection of Catelyn Stark, the humiliation by Ned Stark’s older brother Brandon Stark — back when he cut him from navel to collarbone and didn’t kill him after their duel over Catelyn in their youth.
He’s put back in that position again.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game 0f Thrones What was your last day like?
My last day on the set wasn’t that scene.
The execution was the second scene I shot.
I quite enjoyed doing things that way — shooting Littlefinger’s death and then shooting what comes before.
When you know what’s coming you relax a little in the way you interact with the others.
There’s something else that seeps into your performance — a kind of serenity.
But yeah, I did find it quite emotional shooting the finale scene.
And I don’t necessarily mean that I was sad, but it’s an emotional moment for the character so I felt what he was feeling.
For the real last day at work Dan and David weren’t there but co-executive producer Bryan Cogman called people in and said a few words and my son was there with me.
That was quite something.
And I got my mockingbird pin.
I had already let them know I wanted it, and I cleverly worked it so I got two.
There’s one from my cloak and one from my tunic.
So I got the large and the small size — one for me and one for my son.
Was your favorite scene that one where Littlefinger gives a speech threatening Ros? You’ve mentioned that one a few times before.
It’s one of my favorite scenes.
It was a good establisher in season 2 and we learn more about him in that.
There were others I’ve enjoyed as much — probably the scene with Sansa in the courtyard where I kissed her while talking about her mother; that’s where we start to see how this is all mixed up in his head.
I’ve continued to try to bring a bit of warmth and affability to a character who is shadowy, villainous and even treacherous.
I thought it was my job to try to make people like him.
Ultimately one could say it’s better to be the climactic death of the season 7 finale than potentially one of several major events within the final season, right?
You know, I did pretty well.
The character did pretty well.
They need to hone the cast down.
That’s not an issue, really.
The end is when it happens.
I don’t think beyond that.

Game of Thrones stars react to that huge Jon Snow reveal 
— How that Jon Snow twist changes everything 
Finale podcastThis article originally appeared on Ew.
com
WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
So.
Emilia Clarke.
How do you think Daenerys Targaryen is going to react in the final season of Game of Thrones to the rather stunning news that her lover Jon Snow is also her nephew? We asked the Game of Thrones star this question while she sat on folding chair amid the ancient Roman ruins of Italica outside Seville, Spain last fall.
The production used the historical location for King’s Landing’s famed Dragonpit in Sunday’s emotional finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
Clarke paused, considering.
Then she loudly cried: Ewwwww! and laughed.
I think that’s how it’s going to go.
I get the toothbrush— she pretended to frantically brush her tongue.
It was a hilarious reaction that underscores the rather seriously emotional game-changing revelation that threatens to shake up the final season of Game of Thrones.
I pointed out that Daenerys has presumably long assumed she’ll avoid her family’s long predilection for incest.
Exactly! Clarke says.
And then I walked back into it.
And what about the fact that Jon Snow — er, Aegon Targaryen — has a better claim to the Iron Throne than she does? I’ve worked so hard, I don’t want to share that throne, she replied.
No.
The throne’s big enough for one dragon bum, and that’s mine.
That’s it!FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game of Thrones For costar Kit Harington, his main concern was figuring out how to realistically ramp up their romance with each of their pivotal scenes across four episodes — which led to some amusing behind the scenes debate.
Usually you go into a movie and meet your costar for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time, Harington says.
But if you’ve known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we’re both kind of freaking out about it.
I would be like, What’s the sexual tension in this scene?’ and she’s like, Stop talking about sexual tension!’ It’s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.
Concurs Clarke: Yeah I would say, Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don’t keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time,’ and added about the scene itself: I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it’s a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.
The turning point for Daenerys, Clarke notes, was when Jon left her to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight.
She’s just like: Why don’t I want you do go? Why don’t I want you— doooooon’t fall for him.
Don’t do it! There’s a battle going in on herself.
As for Harington’s reaction to his character’s parentage news next season, the actor would only say, I said to Emilia it’s going to be a really cool scene when they find out.
And how will the reveal impact their relationship? That part of it, I can’t predict, he says.
It could be them walking off into the sunset.
It could be them killing each other.

Psychosexual therapist Mike Lousada rationalizes the hypocrisy of shipping Jon/Daenerys and finding Cersei/Jaime wrong. 
“There’s nothing wrong with people wanting that. The fantasy of taboo is always going to be exciting—to have that thrill enacted, and we know that it’s fantasy. To enact that in real life, to say that’s a justification for incest, no, that’s not OK.”
“We put ourselves in the shoes of the characters—we empathize with them, and that’s why the show resonates with so many people,” Lousada continues. “We can all feel ourselves in many of the characters in the plot. What if we put ourselves in the role of Jon—wouldn’t you be attracted to Dany, and vice versa?”

The difference between Cersei/Jaime and Dany/Jon is that Dany and Jon do not know they are related (duh? Captain obvious...), although the concept called genetic sexual attraction is common in real life, and there are numerous cases of estranged relatives ending up in a relationship.

“If we take the idea of sameness being attractive, we like what we know, what is familiar,” says Lousada. “There’s a narcissistic mirror in the other; there’s that biological sameness that’s going to create similar characteristics. They’re both driven. They’re leaders.... They have similar characteristics.”


-They shot a scene where Sansa finally checks in with Bran to get the scoop on who to trust: "We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, “I need your help,” or something along those lines. So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, 'Oh, shit.'"

-Doesn't think Bran will warm up to people anytime soon since he's too focused on the White Walkers to the exclusion of all else

-Doesn't know who's going to drop the Maury truth bomb on Jon

 I knew he was named after Jon Arryn, but hadn't thought about the depth behind it.
Edit: I don't know why so many people are missing the actual point of OP's post. Yes, the kids' names all had meaning. But OP specifically said: "But then I remembered that Jon is named after Jon Arryn, the man who wasn't Ned's father, but raised him like a son."
This is the significant piece. Jon Arryn wasn't Ned's father, but Jon Arryn raised Ned as though he was his own son. In turn, Ned decided that although he was not this child's father, he was going to raise him like his own son. Thus, he named him Jon. The parallel between those two relationships is the depth in the name.

Ned thought of Arryn as an adoptive father, and thinks of Jon Arryn when he decides to adopt him as his bastard. If was thinking of protecting him from Robert Baratheon, he couldn't have chosen a name that elicited more familiarity to BobbyB.

It is suggested that the Night's King was a Flint, among the many possibilities. Lord Commander Rodrik Flint is regarded as one of the worst commanders of the Night's Watch, for trying to make himself King-Beyond-the-Wall. One of the dark legends surrounding the Nightfort is the rape and murder of brave young Danny Flint.

Looks like George R.R. Martin can take a breather. An engineer set up a neural network using all of the books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series to write part of the next installment, The Winds of Winter. It may not make a lot of sense—or any sense, really—but hell, neither did that whole Sansa and Arya murder fake-out.

Full-stack software engineer Zack Thoutt created a recurrent neural network to write The Winds of Winter, based on words, phrases, and characters from the rest of the series. Thoutt told Motherboard it’s a “long short-term memory” network, meaning it remembers information stored in the text, like character deaths. It’s not exactly accurate, though, as according to the new book Ned and Lord Mormont have returned from the grave.

In order to accomplish a feat that not even Martin himself has been able to dachieve yet, Thoutt uploaded the first five books in the series into the network (almost 5,400 pages worth) so it could spew out the latest twists, turns, and deaths in the iconic series. Here’s a small sample from Chapter One, narrated by Tyrion:

The Hound found Jeyne Poole. Ser Meryn Trant had sent King Yoren through the harbor, to summon the black brothers who had donned his horned veins. The fools he’d wed with him, had all been reborn. “Why, I know? He was bleeding, covered his whole legs on shoulders of the snow. He will stand on deck for the fish a fortnight, and never kill one. A blade is no longer, yes, she thought, but he couldn’t take much food.

He could not help himself at first rush. Ghost came by, in a camp when Asha hunted to the night’s watch. Now the torches beneath them and the rose in his head or we’ve brought them out of the world. He is stubborn and stupid, but his council never saved my brother as most. “There must be five choices,” he pointed out.

It is an effort. Mine uncle had do the same color. She could hardly count by death.

It made Ned better stop until the fire was falling, standing beneath the arch of a shattered still distant field where the shadow tower paid the camp behind. The elder brother had known no sun and chunks of broken buildings and ash wailing towns; four hundred thousand ravens, his own torsos. Behind them wore their black cloaks like their own yellow fish heroes wearing a rough-hewn figurehead, a black trout slashed on a huge chest, with colors crossed inside and forth their heads. Lords and nuts and mussels, cloaks of the shore, several hundred riders down beneath the honeywine, and at the foot of the five southron Kings of captured sit and fewer stepped toward the Kingslayer. He will not return yet at the ford, with above his first black band.

“Only a hundred northmen will remain with them. They’ll teach you Lord Rickard’s brother Joffrey. Tell me true, Cersei is known. No one’s wasting your interest, you remember. Dead steel and sour cat and two times as well.”
There are five chapters so far, and they’re all insane. According to the neural network, Varys is going to poison Daenerys, Asha will start hunting the Night’s Watch, and Arya’s latest weapon of choice is her boot. But hey, it actually predicts a couple of things that fans also expect to happen on the final season of Game of Thrones, mainly that Jon Snow will ride a dragon and Jaime Lannister will kill his twin sister Cersei. However, all of that pales in comparison to the best part: The Winds of Winter has a new character!

Greenbeard was waiting toward the gates, big blind bearded pimple with his fallen body scraped his finger from a ring of white apple. It was half-buried mad on honey of a dried brain, of two rangers, a heavy frey.

“Six men wanted to kill one Stark, this grey o’ all of three.”
According to the neural network, the latest addition to Westeros will be a man called Greenbeard, and all I want is everything about this character’s epic backstory. I’d like to imagine he’s a greenseer sent by the Children of the Forest to help Jon Snow battle the Night’s King, and he colored his facial hair green because he takes his role way too seriously.

The Long Night Beyond Westeros

In “modern” Westeros—at least, before Jon and his motley crew brought back a wight to dump in front of Cersei Lannister—the story of the Long Night has faded into fairytale, and the seven kingdoms are not the only place that have myths surrounding the Others’ invasion. In Essos, the Long Night is believed to have been the event that caused the Rhoyne, one of the primary rivers in the Western side of that continent, to freeze over entirely, indicating the events of the generations-long winter even impacting lands beyond the Narrow Sea. In Rhoynar folklore, however, there were no White Walkers behind the events, and instead it’s believed that the Long Night was ended by an unnamed hero uniting the people who lived along the river to sing a song that thawed its waters.

Even further East into Essos, tales of the Long Night intermingle with the Asshai legend of Azor Ahai, the legendary warrior who wielded a flaming sword called Lightbringer. In Yi Ti, it is believed that the Long Night was brought about when a goddess called the Maiden-Made-of-Light turned her back on the world, unleashing the Lion of the Night, a demon who plagued the world with cold and darkness until Azor Ahai—seemingly conflated with the Last Hero of Westerosi folklore—united humanity to defeat the Lion of the Night’s forces. Thanks to Melisandre and her fellow followers of R’hllor, we know the legend of Azor Ahai took hold and spread to Westeros, with the prophecy that his return to save mankind once again would come when the Others made their presence known again.

Although thousands of years have passed since the Others last invaded, it’s hard to say that Westeros is more prepared for their return now than they were when the Long Night began all those millennia ago. If anything, this time there seems to be less hope—season seven’s finale was all about highlighting just how fractured the various major powers of the seven kingdoms are at the moment, a stark contrast to the unity of the First Men that eventually saw the Others repelled. On top of that, this time the Children aren’t around to help fight back against the oncoming hordes.

We’ll have to wait for the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones (and that might be a pretty good wait at this point) to see how—or if—humanity will defeat the White Walkers and their forces for the second time. Suffice it to say, their chances don’t look good.

The Rise of the Night King

Unfortunately, the newly formed Night’s Watch nearly failed in their new quest almost immediately (or, at least “immediately” in the grand scheme of 8,000 years). The 13th commander of the Watch fell in love with a mysterious woman with pale blue eyes and icy skin, widely believed to be a female White Walker. After making love to the woman, the Commander’s soul was bound to hers, and he returned to the Watch to place his men under their thrall, declaring themselves their King and Queen and committing countless atrocities. When it was discovered that the Night King was making sacrifices to the Others beyond the Wall, the Free Folk and House Stark made an alliance to defeat the King and his forces. When the Night’s Watch resumed its duties following their victory, the Commander’s name and history was stricken from their records, cast aside and forbidden to be spoken of ever again. Up until the recent events of Game of Thrones, it would be the last time the Others would threaten the peace of Westeros for thousands of years.

The TV show has revealed its version of the Night King to have been a human who was turned into the first White Walker by the Children of the Forest. His purpose was to be used as a weapon against the First Men after the Children magically embedded a dragonglass dagger in his torso, revealed in the season six episode “The Door.” This version clearly contradicts the Night King discussed in the books, as the Night’s Watch would not be created until many years after this event.

The Last Hero

When the Others first invaded the south, the Children and the First Men were outmatched by a relentless army that couldn’t die, but only grew stronger with every person they killed, and both societies were pushed further and further into the south of Westeros. Legends from the northern regions of current Westeros state that in the darkest days of the Long Night, the First Men discovered that wights could be killed by dragonglass, the weapon of choice coveted by the Children of the Forest. A figure known only as the Last Hero supposedly trekked through the White Walker-occupied regions to plead with the Children to lend their dragonglass weapons to beat back the Others, with all of his companions—down to his faithful dog—perishing over the course of the journey, until he reached the Children and gained their trust.

With the ability to fight back against the White Walkers, the alliance between the First Men and the Children pushed back the Others bit by bit. A group of men used the shared dragonglass to fight back against the Others alongside the Last Hero, becoming an early incarnation of the Night’s Watch. Eventually, the White Walker horde was pushed back into the Northern wastes it came from in a grand battle called the Battle for the Dawn, ending the Long Night and resoundingly routing the Others. It was then that Bran the Builder—the legendary founder of House Stark—supposedly raised the Wall, a structure of ice and Children magic that stretched across Westeros, and entrusted the Night’s Watch to guard it, ensuring that the Others could never threaten Westeros again.

Westeros Before the Long Night

It’s been over 8,000 years since the White Walkers stalked Westeros—thousands of years before Aegon Targaryen landed on its shores and claimed the region for his family. The Westeros we see in Game of Thrones was much different from the one that faced the Long Night all those years ago—a land where magic and strange creatures still existed in abundance. The White Walkers came to a Westeros that had spent the last two millennia in relative peace after the Children of the Forest and the First Men who’d landed in the region signed an agreement called the Pact, which saw the two societies live in harmony after the First Men’s arrival had led to the forests of the Children being cut down for wood. But the arrival of a long winter, one that spanned generations of Children and men alike, heralded a threat that nearly wiped both races out altogether.

In the books, the origins of the Others—the collective name for the wights and their undead armies, which could include everything from zombie humans to giant frost spiders—in the northernmost point of the land are still unknown. They could just be a natural entity found in the far frozen north, rarely encountered over the years because of the impossible hostile climate they live in, or they could be a tribe of First Men killed and resurrected by dark magics for some mysterious reason. Either way, the long winter—eventually referred to as the Long Night—allowed them to march further south into the lands occupied by the Children and the First Men, sacking their villages and turning the survivors into wights like themselves.

The stage has been set for Game of Thrones’ final season, as a terribly divided Westeros faces an invasion by the White Walkers... but this won’t be the first time they’ve tried to eradicate humanity. Here’s everything we know about the first war between humans and the Walkers—and what it can tell us about the war to come next season.

Obviously, the most pressing question after last night’s episode is the fate of Tormund, everyone’s favorite Wilding beardo. In the final scene of “The Dragon and the Wolf,” the Night King and his newly-reanimated wight dragon obliterated the Eastwatch garrison and tore a gargantuan chunk out of the Wall, allowing for the army of White Walkers and wights to make their way into Westeros.

As insane as the scene was to watch, perhaps the most shocking thing about it was the implication that Tormund might not have survived the attack, given that he was rushing to get off the Wall as the undead dragon fire (or whatever) was tearing it apart. It’d be shocking if a character as prominent as Tormund was given an off-screen death, but if there’s one thing to have learned from this past season of Game of Thrones, it’s that the show isn’t terribly concerned with giving fans exactly what they want.

Will we ever witness Cleganebowl?


“The Dragon and the Wolf” very briefly teased us with a taste of Cleganebowl when the the Hound and the Mountain came face to face during the Meeting of queens, but the encounter didn’t lead to the brothers finally fighting to the death the way we all desperately want to see. At this point in the series, both Cleganes have been touched by some form of the supernatural, with Sandor witnessing a vision from the Lord of Light in a fire, and Gregor becoming some kind of putrid zombie warrior.

It’d be absolutely fantastic to see the Cleganes duke it out, ideally with Qyburn muttering to no one in particular about how he brought the Mountain back from the dead and Sandor growling about just what the Lord of Light showed him.

Will Theon save Yara?


In a moment of uncharacteristic bravery, Theon stands up to the group of other Iron Islanders he’s with and announces his plans to head home and rescue his sister (the rightful queen of the Iron Islands) from their uncle Euron. As lovely as it is to finally see Theon doing the right thing, it’s difficult to say whether he’ll be successful in his endeavor, considering Cersei’s secret plot to send Euron to Essos to collect the Golden Company while everyone assumes that he’s retreating to the Iron Islands.

The issue here is that we don’t know exactly where Yara is right now. Last we saw her, she and Ellaria Sand were being led through King’s Landing on their way to be punished by Cersei. It’s unclear if Yara’s still somewhere in King’s Landing, if she’s been sent back to the Iron Islands, or if Euron’s kept her with him. Given that Theon hopped into a boat, it seems as if he thinks she’s back at home, which is a bit of a gamble, but one that could play into the ultimate showdown between the living and the dead. Now that the Night King has that fancy new steed of his, it seems like next season would be the perfect time for a certain magical instrument from the books that could level the playing field to make an appearance.

How does the Night King’s ice dragon work and can it be killed?


From the moment that we saw the Night King kill and then re-animate Viserion last week, it was clear that the season finale would involve seeing the leader of the White Walkers riding an undead dragon south and wreaking all kinds of ice-magic havoc. What’s less obvious about the wight Viserion is just how exactly he works, considering his unique origins.

Up until this point, dragons and their fire have been the sort of magical foil to the White Walkers and their cold in Game of Thrones, but Viserion now straddles the gap between the two sources of the show’s magic in a unique way. During the last scene of the season finale, we saw that the dragon is now capable of breathing some sort of blue, flame-like substance that easily tore a hole through the Wall. But the idea that an undead dragon reanimated by magic from an ice being would breath literal fire is a little iffy. Remember, it only takes a little bit of fire to seriously mess the White Walkers and wights up.

Viserion’s new “flames” could be some form of concussive ice breath that we should expect to see him using on his brothers next season, but there are still questions about whether Viserion can even be killed anymore, given that a) he’s still a dragon (they’re durable as hell) and b) it’s doubtful anyone’s crafted a huge obsidian arrow to shoot a zombie dragon down with. We’ll see.

How will everyone feel about Jon and Daenerys?


After years of alluding to the truth about Jon Snow’s identity, Bran and Sam put their heads together and confirmed that Jon is, in fact, Aegon Targaryen, Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen’s secret lovechild, making Daenerys his aunt (whom he promptly had sex with). It seems off that Lyanna and Rhaegar would name their son Aegon because Rhaegar had another son by the same name with Ellia Martell. Chalk it up to Rhaegar not being the world’s most creative dad.

There were a lot of emotions tied to Jon and Dany’s incestuous sex scene last night, but it’s worth bearing in mind that incest is kind of a Targaryen tradition and neither of them knows about it yet. Also, it’s not like these two are even the show’s most high-profile couple keeping it in the family currently. That being said, there’s a good chance that once word of Jon’s heritage spreads, there will be a variety of different reactions from people with connections to the two Targaryens. Tyrion was visibly... perturbed when he overheard the dragonfolk getting busy through their door and it stands to reason that Jon might be somewhat shocked to learn that he’s gotten it on with his father’s sister. Daenerys’ reaction, though, is likely to be the most interesting given that Jon’s claim to the throne is now stronger than hers, but he’s already bent the knee to her.

Is Daenerys going to become pregnant?


Now that the show’s acknowledged who Jon really is and he’s had sex with Daenerys, there’s a chance—even though Dany went out of her way to remind us that she doesn’t think she’s capable of having any more children—that the two of them could could produce an heir that would eventually play a key role in the future of the seven kingdoms.

If Daenerys does manage to get pregnant, though, it’s unlikely we’d see her go through the entire pregnancy next season, seeing as how the Night King and the army of the dead are already pretty much beelining their way into mainland Westeros. Speaking of pregnancies...

Is Cersei really pregnant?


Even though we’ve seen her covertly meeting with Master Qyburn for unknown reasons, and we know she and Jaime have still been having sex, I wouldn’t put it past Cersei to fake a pregnancy as a power move to trick everyone around her. When Jaime tries to impress upon Cersei that he’s the only family she has left, Cersei indicates that she’s carrying at least one more blood relative and very overtly insinuates that she’s prepared to kill Jaime in light of his recent betrayals.

Still, though, if Cersei is playing the long game, it’s difficult to understand what she’s going for. She knows that the White Walkers are real—and she saw snow fall in King’s Landing—but she apparently doesn’t consider that reason enough to get her shit together to help fend them off. Her scheme to bring the Golden Company to Westeros to take back the lands that Daenerys abandons is certainly a clever one in the short term, but what will it amount to if the dead defeat the first line of the living and then make their way farther south? All the money in the world won’t stop the wights from murdering people, but Cersei seems not to quite understand that. Perhaps she plans to flee across the sea with her baby?

Who is the Azor Ahai?


It would make an awful lot of sense if Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen turned out to be the Azor Ahai, destined to be reborn as the Prince (or Princess) That Was Promised who will fight back the impending darkness that threatens to envelop the world.

Melisandre’s already cast her vote for Jon, though other Red Priestesses throughout the world have also suggested Daenerys as the prophesied savior. The Azor Ahai could also be Jon and Dany’s child (if they ever have one), but again, the dead are already marching on Westeros and the living don’t really have the time to wait for Baby Targaryen to grow up and save them.

Who will sit on the Iron Throne?


This is literally the point of the entire show—and right now, the answer to this question is entirely up in the air. There are still more than enough power players on the board to make Game of Thrones’ series finale a complete mystery, which is heartening given how rushed this season felt. If season seven was all about getting characters to where they need to be in order to make this final act truly epic, then hopefully season eight will give us the fitting drama and intrigue as the series comes to a close.

With just one season of Game of Thrones left to go, there are still a number of burning questions about the future of the Seven Kingdoms that last night’s season finale left unanswered.

Let’s not mince words here: season seven was more focused on getting things into their proper places in anticipation of the series’ end. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but rather an unexpected pivot from a show that’s excelled at giving its plot time and space to play out organically.

But even if we accept this past season as more soap opera than prestige drama, you can’t deny that “The Wolf and the Dragon” was meant to leave us wildly speculating about what to expect next. With that in mind, here are all of the dangling plot points we still need resolved.

If he played your record, it was a hit.
If he didn’t play your record, it wasn’t a hit.
But when he heard mine he knew what he had.
Just like he started Elvis off the same way — so I’ve been told.
You played with Elvis, as well as Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, at the famous Million Dollar Quartet session.
Yes, Sam Phillips was responsible for that.
He knew what he was doing the whole time.
You don’t know how much trouble he caused me! laughs
Was it fun?
A lot of fun.
I never regret one minute of it.
It was just the 40th anniversary of Elvis Presley’s death.
Do you have any memories that you’d like to share of your time with him?
We had some great times riding motorcycles, and racing cars! He always took my advice.
Little did he know I wasn’t giving him great advice…laughs
Who would win when you were racing?
We both had Eldorado Cadillacs.
Same year.
I was coming down the street, Elvis was coming down the street.
I saw this black Eldorado pull over into my line.
I thought, Whoever the hell this is, I guess we’re playing ‘Chicken.
’ So we were blowin’ those Eldorados up Union Avenue just in front of the record store.
We pulled right up to each other.
He jumped out of his car, and I jumped of mine, and I didn’t know what else to do.
He said, I’m gonna sue you! I said, Sue me? Man, for what? He said, Mean Woman Blues.
He couldn’t get over that I covered him on it.
I didn’t know I covered him on it! I had no idea.
I rewrote it, I put different words over the tune.
I ain’t bragging but it’s understood, everything I do I sure do it good.
Stuff like that, I added to it.
You’ve always had your own way with words.
They said Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On and Great Balls of Fire were risqué records.
I couldn’t see anything risqué about it!
Did that hurt you?
It didn’t hurt me, but it made me wonder — how could I be so stupid that I didn’t know what this meant? I am not risqué! laughs

What makes you happy now when you’re not playing music?
My favorite thing to do nowadays is stay at home with my puppies and my wife and my son, Jerry Lee Lewis III.
And I’ve got two grandchildren — that I know of! laughs
What does rock ‘n’ roll mean to you?
Rock ‘n’ roll? It’s a mixture of boogie woogie and my style.
I kind of introduced rock and roll to the world with Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On.
Elvis was not rock ‘n’ roll, he was rockabilly.
And that’s a lot different from rock ‘n’ roll.
Ohh baby, whole lotta shakin’ goin’ on.
That’s rock ‘n roll.
Elvis, Wanda Jackson, and a few of them, they were rockabilly.
But I was rock ‘n’ roll, and you just can’t beat rock ‘n’ roll.
Announcer Robert Lee Was Pulled to Avoid ‘Social Hectoring and Trolling’
ESPN president John Skipper has explained that the decision to remove Robert Lee as an announcer from Tuesday night’s football game was not because network bosses were worried about offending people.
Skipper sent an internal memo on Wednesday night, later obtained by CNN, which said: There was never any concern — by anyone, at any level — that Robert Lee’s name would offend anyone watching the Charlottesville game.
Among our Charlotte production staff there was a question as to whether — in these divisive times — Robert’s assignment might create a distraction, or even worse, expose him to social hectoring and trolling.
Lee was supposed to announce the University of Virginia’s home opener football game, but was switched to announce Youngstown State University pit against the University of Pittsburgh instead.
The move comes after violence broke out at a white nationalist rally in Virginia.
One person died after being run over at the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The white nationalist groups were originally protesting plans to remove the statue of Confederate Gen.
Robert E.
Lee.
Skipper added that Lee had some hesitation himself about announcing the Virginia game and opted for the Youngstown State/Pitt game when offered.

Mick Jagger's moves are a force NOT to be reckoned with, says sexy roots rocker Grace Potter, who opened for the Rolling Stones last month in both Minneapolis and Dallas.
Potter got to duet with Mick on Gimme Shelter,  but she tells our photog it came with a disclaimer courtesy of guitarist Keith Richards daughter Theodora: Don't out swagger the Jagger.
Potter's got moves of her own - she's known to kick up a heel and scale a piano in one of her token short dresses - but check out her review of 71-year-old Mick, sounds like she's no match for him, or so she says.

EXCLUSIVE! Dance Moms Abby Lee Miller Opens Up About Her Prison Sentence and the Mistakes She Has to Pay for
Abby Lee Miller may be going to prison, but she's not planning to stop working anytime soon.
As the Dance Moms star sat down with E! News days after her prison sentence was announced, one thing was clear about the reality TV veteran: She isn't ready to slow down in the business world.
Someone's already called me to be there to start saying shoot.
We're ready with cameras.
We're ready to go, Abby explained to E! News Jason Kennedy when discussing a return to TV.
I think I'll be ready to go.
If worse comes to worse, I'm a good teacher.
I'm good at what I do.
I have an eye for detail.
I can take a beginner kid that has never danced in their lives and I can teach them something or I can take a really advanced dancer and I can make them into a professional.
The reality star went on to explain that her new dance show will be a scripted project that involves teenagers.
It's kind of where Dance Moms should have left off, she teased.
While some think Abby Lee will have no time to work on any business opportunities during her sentence, she is hopeful that projects can continue as planned.
In fact, the author hopes to complete her sentence in California so businesses can visit.
Tommy Lee's Mile High Club Video Apparently Not Against American Airlines Policy
Tommy Lee won't be busted for possibly busting with his girlfriend in an American Airlines bathroom, because what the 2 did inside is nobody's business but theirs, TMZ has learned.
Our American Airlines sources tell us, there were no complaints filed with the company about Tommy and his gf Brittany Furlan joining the mile high club.
We're told it's NOT against policy for 2 people to use the same lavatory at the same time, and what they do in there is private.
Our sources say typically, when 2 people use the same bathroom, it's the elderly or someone who needs medical assistance, but Tommy and Brittany both appeared to be in good health.
The rocker and his gf didn't create a disturbance on the short flight from Nassau to Miami, so we're told Tommy's off the hook - he won't face a ban.
We reached out to a rep for American Airlines, the company officially has no comment on this matter.
What's funny, though - even though AA seems to be cool with Tommy and Brittany's hookup, she's not happy with them, because she claims the airline lost their luggage.
I just took a 45 min flight from the Bahamas to Miami and @AmericanAir lost our luggage in that short amount of time.
BUYER BEWARE 
Yolanda Hadid Reveals Explosive New Details About Suicidal Thoughts
Yolanda Hadid experienced suicidal thoughts during her battle with Lyme disease and now the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star is detailing the horrific near-death experience in which she was naked and submerged under water, ready to let it all go.
Hadid, 53, chronicled her tragic journey in her new memoir Believe Me: My Battle with the Invisibility of Lyme Disease, where she reveals her illness got so bad she wanted to end her life.
PHOTOS: TV Fakery, Divorce, Criminal Charges & More: Yolanda Hadid’s Secrets Exposed
Circumstances began to spiral out of control for the reality star after her condition worsened despite undergoing several treatments.
The antibiotics that I thought would be the answer to my prayers are actually making me so sick that I feel as if I am going to die.
Even after months of treatment, I’m definitely not cured.
Instead, I’m just desperately trying to hang on, Hadid wrote.
I’ve become a shell of the vivacious and outgoing woman I used to be and can no longer participate in my life.
I choose to live in a quiet cocoon isolated from the outside world, which is the exact opposite of what is required of me as a Housewife.
I’m supposed to be this glamorous woman who lives a fun and exciting life, yet I can barely get dressed.
Two years after her diagnosis, things really took a turn for the worse.
Hadid went on a trip to Florida with ex-husband David Foster, in which she says she stripped off her clothes and submerged herself into the ocean.
PHOTOS: Gigi Hadid Discusses Mother Yolanda’s Battle With Lyme Disease: ‘I’m Very Inspired’
I take off my clothes and slip into the dark blue ocean, which is cool and comforting, she writes in her book, out Sept.
The waves gently wash over my naked body, and I can feel the current tugging at me.
Tears pour out of my eyes, roll across my cheeks, and meld with the salt water as I try to still my mind to become one with the water’s ebb and flow.
God please just take me away in a wave.
I can’t live like this one more day.
Please carry my body away.
I just want to disappear, she recalls.
My next thought is a clear image of my three children.
It shifts my consciousness immediately and that’s the only thing that keeps me from letting myself drift and drown.

Russell Simmons, We Didn't Honor Hitler So Why Honor Robert E.
Lee?
Russell Simmons is clear as a bell, we wouldn't think about erecting a statue honoring Adolf Hitler, so what's the argument for doing the same with Robert E.
Lee? We got Russell out Saturday at Tao in Hollywood and didn't hesitate, honoring people with bad intentions is simply wrong.
Russell was into honoring someone, Dick Gregory, who passed Saturday.
Russell says Gregory inspired Def Comedy Jam which helped launch the careers of a number of African American comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker.
Bill Cosby Hires Michael Jackson Lawyer Tom Mesereau in Sexual Assault Retrial
Bill Cosby just scored one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the country to defend him in his sexual assault retrial, Tom Mesereau.
We're told Mesereau will be lead counsel in the retrial, set for November.
Mesereau has won some legendary cases, he repped Robert Blake, who beat the rap for allegedly murdering his wife Bonnie Lee Bakley.
And he successfully defended Michael Jackson in the singer's child molestation trial.
We're told Bill and Camille Cosby both signed off on Mesereau.
His first appearance in the case will be Tuesday.
We got Mesereau out last month, and he called the retrial a gigantic waste of time.
Chiefs Legend Neil Smith Rescues Pregnant Woman from Flood
Chiefs legend Neil Smith just became even more legendary in Kansas City, rescuing a woman he says was about 9 months pregnant trapped in a K.
C.
area flood on Tuesday.
It all went down in Lee Summit, Missouri, where Smith drove by a woman whose minivan was stalled on a dangerously flooded road.
The 6-time Pro Bowler quickly rushed to her aid - using his 6'4'', near-300 pound frame to guide her out of the waist-high water.
I was just in the right place at the right time, Smith told FOX 4 News in K.
C.
She was very short, so I had to walk her out of there.
The flooding has reportedly led to at least 160 rescues and 1 death, and the former superstar lineman may well have prevented another.
Salute!
Leah Messer Rushes Special Needs Daughter Ali To Hospital For Difficulty Breathing
Leah Messer’s daughter Ali suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy – and her condition has been worsening.
On this week’s Teen Mom 2, the 7-year-old was rushed to the hospital.
On the episode, Messer received an email from Ali’s teacher that she has been falling more in school.
She fell out of her seat and she fell a couple of times, Messer explained.
She’s having a hard time.
She’s getting tired, saying her legs are hurting and tingling.
Her daughter then complained that she doesn’t have enough time to eat her meal because she has trouble opening her lunch.
PHOTOS: Leah Messer Debuts SCARY Skinny Body In Barely-There Bikini: ‘She Looks Sick!’
When she brought up the idea of having an aide help Ali in school, her ex-husband Corey Simms was on board.
Simms then called Messer to inform her that they were bringing their daughter to the hospital.
Ali’s having a hard time catching her breath and I think we need to take her to the emergency room, Simms explained.
She said that she couldn’t breathe.
Better safe than sorry.
When a producer asked Messer if difficulty breathing is a symptom of muscular dystrophy, she refused to answer the question.

Also on the episode, Kailyn Lowry learned that Jenelle Evans broke the news of her pregnancy over Twitter.
I haven’t announced my pregnancy publically yet, but last night the news came out from an unexpected source, Lowry said of a tweet Evans posted, which read, Congrats on your pregnancy girl! Heard the news from the crew.
Super happy for you.
Having 3 is hard but totally worth it!
Lowry vented to a friend, My pregnancy has been hard and I wasn’t really telling anyone.
I didn’t want to talk about it in public or anything.
I’m afraid of not having control of my own story.
Lowry continued, I don’t know if she was doing it to be a smart a** or if she was doing it thinking she was really congratulating me.
I was upset because I had not had my 20-week scan yet.
I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
PHOTOS: ‘Teen Mom’ 2 Star Leah Messer’s Secrets & Scandals Revealed
When Lowry bashed Evans on an after show, she accused Lowry’s ex-husband Javi Marroquin of leaking the news.
Evans then sent her a screen shot of Marroquin confirming the pregnancy over Twitter.
If I could text Javi right now… what a dumb a**, she fired.
How about I air out all of his dirty laundry? I could literally show videos of Javi doing things that he shouldn’t be doing.
She then explained, I could show naked pictures of him having s** with someone else while he was overseas, but I won’t.
I kept my mouth shut.
Briana DeJesus also had issues with her baby daddy on this week’s episode, as Luis refused to agree to place their daughter for adoption.
PHOTOS: Meet Kailyn’s Baby Boy! See First Photos Of Teen Mom Lowry’s Newborn Son
It doesn’t have to be a bad situation, Luis told her mother Roxanne.
I told her I wasn’t on board with the adoption thing.
I’m going to be there regardless.
Roxanne fired back, You already have a daughter and you’re not there.
Luis shot back, I might not be there daily, but I’m there from my daughter.
Whatever she needs from me.
Roxanne responded, Not whatever, kids need something every single day.
Briana is going to have to carry the brunt of it no matter what.
She’s going to be born into a world of chaos.
PHOTOS: Back On? Kailyn Lowry Heads Home From Hospital With Baby Daddy Chris!
DeJesus then explained how they will not put Stella up for adoption because Luis will not agree to it.
We’re not talking about adoption anymore, she said.
We got to figure out what we’re going to do for this baby on our end.
Have this f**king baby in the f**king house with us and enjoy her like we enjoy Nova.
And finally, Chelsea Houska became upset with her daughter Aubree for being rough with their chickens.
Were you trying to be careful? she asked.
Those are living animals, you know that right? You need to be gentle.
You’re not allowed to hold them anymore unless someone is helping you.
PHOTOS: Inside Chelsea Houska’s Dream Home!
When a producer brought up the issue later on, Houska refused to discuss it.
I’m not going into that for everybody, she said.
We’re not going into this so we can make it into something.

The start of September is the traditional period of going back to school, whether you’re an actual student or a fictional wizard, but today—September 1st, 2017—holds a very particular place in the hearts of Harry Potter fans: It’s the day the “19 years later” epilogue of The Deathly Hallows is set.

In the years since the books, and later the films, came to a close, J.K. Rowling has dropped all sorts of tidbits on social media about just what Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the cast have been up to in the two decades and beyond since Voldemort’s defeat. Hell, we even got that stage play out of it! But while fans are out in force visiting King’s Cross Station today, we thought we’d mark the occasion of the still-terribly-named Albus Severus Potter’s first day at Hogwarts by asking you to imagine what the hell everyone, big and small in the Potterverse, is up to in 2017.

What’s wizarding Twitter like? Is Cho Chang incredibly glad she stayed away from Harry and all the boy-who-lived bullshit he’s had to live up to? How’s Mrs. Figg? What about Bill and Fleur’s kids? Sound off in the comments and give us a Pottermoore-worthy faux-factoid.

Season seven of Game of Thrones has been exciting and dreadfully sloppy in equal measure. Important character arcs are rushed, motivations are confusing, and reality has gone out the window in terms of how quickly characters move between locations—particularly the route from Dragonstone to the Wall.

Jon made the journey to meet Daenerys in no time at all, and last episode the show would like us to believe Gendry ran (I guess?) from Wildling country all the way back to Eastwatch in what felt like a matter of hours. How are these people suddenly capable of Breath of the Wild-style fast travel when others (Arya, for instance) spend whole seasons wandering? An eagle-eyed Snapchat user has the answer: a goddamn pickup truck.


Image: Snapchat via Twitter
“But wait, I don’t remember that shot at all,” you may be thinking. As TV Guide points out, that’s because the scene containing the truck gaffe is part of the behind-the-scenes segment that plays after each episode which nearly everyone refuses to watch. A truck never appeared in episode six, so please don’t knock the editors of the show.

But a truck was north of the Wall. And I dare anyone to think of a better explanation for how this journey keeps getting shorter and shorter in a society where—for everyone except Daenerys—the fastest mode of transportation is horses. Dragonstone to the Wall is more than half the length of all of Westeros, and traveling in a straight line from one to the other passes through four unavoidable bodies of water.

The show may essentially be in fanfic territory right now, but for my money, the pickup truck is canon.

Season seven of Game of Thrones, short as it is, has been surprisingly light on major deaths. Sure, there have been people who have died, but nothing on the level that we’ve come to expect from a show that, last year, had us deeply mourning the death of Hodor. So chances are this Sunday’s finale will have at last one big death coming—and based on where the show seems to be heading and some clues from the book, we have some guesses.


Let me start by saying that, interestingly, while George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones have acquired the reputation of killing off characters in shocking ways, the books have only ever permanently killed off one major point-of-view character: Ned Stark. (Note for TV-only fans: A Song of Ice and Fire’s chapters are from the point of view of certain characters. A few minor characters have point-of-view chapters, but the vast majority of the chapters come from Eddard Stark, Catelyn Stark [dead in the show, but undead in the books], Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, Bran, Sansa, Arya, Theon, Davos, Jaime, Cersei, Samwell Tarly, and Brienne of Tarth.) Jon’s life, in the books, is still currently hanging a bit in the balance, but we all know he’s not dead.

In the TV show, there’s no real way to convey which characters are POV or not, so deaths for TV-only viewers are actually more shocking since they don’t know which characters are vital for storytelling. While the show’s already broken with this pattern in keeping Catelyn Stark off the board and in the afterlife, there would be some parallelism with Ned’s first season death in not killing off another major POV character until the final book, which might hint that we won’t see one of the aforementioned characters die until the final season and not this Sunday.


One—or even both—of these two is going die. One of them should have died during the battle with the Army of the Dead. The army, with its new dragon, is definitely headed for the Wall in this finale, where Beric and Tormund stayed behind. Beric’s death is almost a certainty—killing Thoros in the last episode was basically a reminder that Beric was continually brought back to life by Thoros. Without him, Beric can’t be resurrected and his next death with be his final one.

Tormund might make it a little bit longer, but what says things are serious more than one death? Two. Two deaths.



If Littlefinger doesn’t die in the finale, then story structure has lost all meaning. The only reason for the interminable storyline about Arya and Sansa manipulating each other is to bring them together in the end over the corpse of Littlefinger. More importantly, Littlefinger’s relevance to the actual story has petered out—he’s basically just Sansa’s shoulder demon now. He’s not a major point-of-view character in the books and, in the show, they’ve been ramping up to comeuppance for him.

The only thing holding Littlefinger back from death is if part of this set-up is if Arya is the one who kills Littlefinger and she dies in the process. The show has been setting Arya up as incredibly irrational and sociopathic, and her reconciliation with her sister could come either by killing Littlefinger or dying in the attempt. But Arya’s such an important POV character, it’s hard to see her death coming next week.


It’s Cleganebowl time, everyone! The Hound is headed south with the wight the team captured and we know the Mountain is hanging out behind Cersei, all undead and having not done much at all this season. This is the chance for Cleganebowl to finally come true and pay off all the work that’s been done to get these two in the same place at the same time. Plus, we still haven’t seen the shot of the Hound drawing his sword that was in the trailer—but the background sure looks like the place everyone’s meeting that we saw in the promo for the season finale.

If Cleganebowl finally, to the cheers of fans everywhere, happens, then Gregor absolutely dies (again) and robs Cersei of some of her protection. Whether Sandor dies too is a bit more up in the air, he’s “good” now and the show might be holding out for one more reunion between him and Arya.



While Cersei is a major POV character in the books, her death at some point seems all but assured. Young Cersei got a fortune from Maggy the Frog which stated that she would marry the king, have three children, and “Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds.” In the books—but not the show—Maggy added, “And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”

Valonqar is High Valyrian for little brother, which Cersei assumes means Tyrion, for obvious reasons (mainly that they hate each other). But many fans believe that Jaime, her twin born seconds after her, will kill her as she gets more bitter, vindictive, and blinding by hate, forcing Jaime to murder a Mad Queen much as he killed the Mad King Aerys Targaryen to save the populace of King’s Landing from his plan to destroy the city rather than lose the throne. Now, the TV show has clearly omitted this part of the prophecy, meaning TV Cersei could be killed by anyone or anything, but there’s still a lot of narrative power in the idea of Jaime being compelled to kill her for the greater good. And the show has built up the growing distance between Jaime and Cersei enough that this seems more and more likely.

If nothing else, Cersei claimed to be pregnant earlier this season and having a fourth child would invalidate the part of Maggy’s prophecy the show did use. That kind of puts a ticking clock on killing the queen in accordance with the prophecy, which kind of hints at her dying sooner rather than later. The real question is: will her death come this season or next? The thing in favor of it being this week is that killing Cersei clears the way for next season to have everybody focus on the fight with the White Walkers.



Jaime’s also a big POV character and he’s had something of a redemption arc that could lead to him being spared. But if he ends up killing Cersei and his unborn child, it’s even odds if he decides to continue on or not.


We haven’t seen much of Varys other than to see him counseling Tyrion that he has to reign in Dany. But one big scene we have seen him in is when Melisandre went packing and she told him that she had “to die in this strange country. Just like you.” Varys urging Tyrion to act and Tyrion’s non-answer to Dany’s question about whether or not he was planning a trap for his sister could very well mean that Varys and Tyrion are working together on a contingency plan. And Varys’ plans have included poison in the past.

Varys could be caught, or just get caught in the crossfire and die. While there is rampant fan speculation that Varys and Littlefinger still have a “game” to finish, the show seems to have abandoned that for a while now.

Gendry does have to die. This show shakes out with only one real claimant to the throne, and the endgame is so not Gendry. That said, it’s unlikely he dies before seeing Arya one last time.

If there is one thing we have learned from this show, it’s that Jon Snow’s plot armor is the thickest around and nothing, nothing, will kill him. At least not for long.

Though the show’s never spent too much time fleshing out the personalities of Daenerys’ two smaller dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, last night we saw that at least in that particular way, Viserion takes after the deceased uncle he’s named for. In a moment of crisis when Daenerys needed help the most, Viserion managed to get himself slain by the Night King who, as fate would have it, is an excellent javelin thrower in addition to being a nightmarish ice demon. In a terrifying callback to “The Spoils of War,” where we saw Drogon struck with a massive arrow shot from a huge crossbow, Viserion falls victim to the Night King, who manages to take him down with a single ice spear, causing him to fall into a frozen lake and die.

After Daenerys, Jon, and the rest of the men who’d left in search of a wight head back to the Wall, we see that the White Walkers have dredged Viserion’s body out of the lake and turned him into a wight. (Go on and have a Yu-Gi-Oh chuckle, you’ve earned it.)

Obviously, Viserion’s resurrection raises a number of important questions about just what the hell it all means. For starters, what is Viserion now?


As far as we know right now, Viserion isn’t exactly an “ice dragon” in the way a lot of folks (myself included) immediately assumed when we first saw his newly-ice blue eye open up last night. Rather, he’s a wight like any other living thing that the White Walkers kill and reanimate. The distinction might not seem like an important one, considering that a wight dragon probably would have some form of fire breath, but it’s worth making considering that George R.R. Martin’s already written explicitly about ice dragons before and that’s not quite what Viserion is.

“The road beneath the Wall was as dark and cold as the belly of an ice dragon and as twisty as a serpent.” - Jon’s 8th chapter, A Dance with Dragons
Martin’s The Ice Dragon is a children’s book set in another magical world separate from that of A Song of Ice and Fire, in which a young girl befriends a feared and misunderstood ice dragon who’s a harbinger of winter. There, the ice dragon is a naturally occurring creature who lives contemporaneously with fire-breathing dragons. This ice dragon lives a life of its own, seemingly without any interaction with anyone even vaguely resembling the White Walkers, and it’s able to think for itself.

If Viserion’s anything like the bears and horses the White Walkers have killed, however, then he’s become more of a living weapon than a thinking, feeling being—and could be vulnerable to all the same things other wights are, like fire and dragonglass. There’s a chance that a wight dragon might have some sort of resistance against fire, but George R. R. Martin’s novels are very, very cagey about the natural of dragon’s magic.

“The snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing in from the east along the Wall, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan used to tell.” - Jon’s 10th chapter, A Dance with Dragons
Stories of ice dragons do exist within A Song of Ice and Fire, but it’s never made clear how much of that lore is simply a myth drawn from long-forgotten facts that have become fantastical over time. Jon Snow makes mention of stories that Old Nan once told him as a child about ice dragons, and multiple people reference the ice dragon constellation that features something like a North Star.

When Game of Thrones first began, we could scarcely imagine that by the seventh season, we’d see men with flaming swords fighting undead demon polar bears, but time makes fools of us all. Everything about this season has been equal parts agonizing and wonderful—as is often the case with slow burns that finally begin to pay off—and that’s particularly true of this undead dragon business. We always hoped that this story would close out on a ridiculously epic note, and that was never going to be possible unless there was something that could challenge Daenerys and her dragons.

The Night King’s new pet is the most logical solution to balancing out the power dynamics leading up Game of Thrones’ finale and, as annoying as it is, we’re at a point now in the series where there are no rules about how the magic works. That creepy ass dragon could be just as vulnerable to obsidian as its new, undead family members, or it might only fall victim to the fire of another living dragon. Only time will tell.

If the cracks in Game of Thrones’ post-books storytelling were starting to show last week, they’ve now erupted into to actual fault lines. Last night’s episode was sometimes baffling, and occasionally outright sloppy on a storytelling level, as characters made countless questionable decisions—and yet the show continued to astonish with such incredibly epic, fantastic moments that it almost didn’t matter. Almost.


“Beyond the Wall” is primarily set—wait for it—beyond the Wall, following the inglorious bastard and his band of badasses on their search for a wight. Like many of Game of Thrones’ epic battle episodes, it starts out slow, giving them all a chance to talk with each other: Gendry bitches to Beric and Thoros about selling him to Melisandre; Jon tries to give Jorah his ancestral sword but Jorah refuses; Tormund decides he and the Hound are BFFs, which is totally hilarious; Beric and Jon commiserate about being resurrected; and so on. There’s nothing revelatory here, but it does an impressive job of setting up camaraderie between the seven men, most of whom hadn’t met each other before the end of the last episode, before shit goes down.

And man, does it go down. It begins with them getting attacked by a damn zombie bear, complete with ice-blue eyes, which is a subtle but incredibly effective harbinger of things to come. This fight goes about as well as a fight with a zombie bear should, which is to say not very; the bear keeps attacking even after Beric sets it on fire with his flaming sword, and mauls Thoros a bit. Eventually Jorah drives a dagger into its brain, killing it, and Beric has to use his sword to cauterize Thoros’ wounds, and they press on.

Eventually, Jon spies a small group of wights being led by a White Walker. The group attacks, and in short order Jon kills the Walker thanks to Longclaw and its Valyrian steel; when he shatters, most of the wights literally fall apart as well. Thankfully (and very coincidentally) one survives, and the men all basically dogpile on the zombie until they can tie it up... but not before the wight screams. And the rest of the undead army hears.

Jon sends Gendry, the youngest/fastest, to run back to Eastwatch as fast as he can go to send a raven to Daenerys. The rest of them run too, but they only manage to get to a small island on a frozen lake. However, when the wights attack, their weight is too much and the ice cracks, sending them plummeting into the water. The end result is that Jon, Jorah, Tormund, Beric, Thoros, and the Hound are surrounded on all sides by thousands of wights, protected only by a ring of thin ice.

And then they wait. In a season where everything has felt so rushed, with people and armies and dragons zipping back and forth, it was weirdly satisfying to watch Jon and the others just stand on that little hill as the day turned into night, and the next day came, all worried that the ice would freeze enough that the wights can come attack them, waiting for Daenerys and her dragons to save their frozen asses. Which she does, but not before the Hound throws a rock at the wights, misses, and accidentally reveals the ice has indeed frozen over, and it’s perfectly safe now for zombies to go murder the living.


Game of Thrones has given us some stunningly realistic battles before, and this is absolutely not one of them. These five characters (Thoros died in his sleep) fight countless wights for god knows how long, despite being outnumbered one to a thousand. Game of Thrones has never felt more like a Dungeons & Dragons game—a group of 10th level fighters, paladins, and barbarians against a horde of 0th level undead, Jon has his Magic Sword +5, Beric his Sword with +4 Fire Damage, the Hound has Gendry’s Very Large Hammer, and so forth. But it’s still Jon Snow, Jorah, Tormund, Beric, and Sandor Clegane against the army of the White Walkers, and thus it’s awesome, even when Jon inexplicably tells them all to “Fall back!” despite the fact there is literally no place for them to fall back to.

Just because you know it’s coming doesn’t make Dany’s arrival—with all! three! dragons!—any less jaw-dropping. The dragons just lay waste to the wights, vomiting hot lava on scores of them at a time. In fact, despite their numbers, you’d be forgiven for wondering how the hell the undead would have a chance to fight Dany’s fire-spewing children… until the Night’s King hurls an ice spear at Viserion, killing him, and sending his massive body crashing into the ice, and then the water below.

Viserion’s death makes Nymeria’s rejection of Arya and Winterfall feel like a mild bummer in comparison. I’m not sure Emilia Clarke’s acting sells it, but the dragons have been such a key part of her character—for all intents and purposes, her actual children—and such a key part of the series it was almost as heartbreaking to watch the dragon die as it was Ned Stark die. And the show’s special effects have never been better than when they’re showing Viserion’s plummet to the ground, the way his body slide-crashes across the ice, and then is slowly dragged under water by his own weight—it’s brutal.

Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t make Jon Snow’s decision to start needlessly attacking wights instead of hopping on Drogon’s back with the others any less dumb or nonsensical. It’s only when he sees the Night’s King pull out a second ice spear that he runs to join Daenerys and the others—only to be caught by wights and pulled below the ice as well. Although she’s clearly loathe to leave Jon behind, the Mother of Dragons is not willing to lose another child, and she flies off, the spear barely missing Drogon.

The show takes a suspiciously long time for Jon to pull himself out of the water, hauling himself back up, only to find himself surrounded by wights again. With Jon facing certain death a third time, Game of Thrones shamelessly uses another deus ex machina at the last minute to save him—this time it’s Uncle Benjen, who rushes in on his horse, sets the exhausted, frozen Jon on it, and sends it back to Eastwatch, and fights the wights himself. I am genuinely a little disappointed in myself that I exulted a bit at Benjen showing up out of nowhere to save the day; I guess because his disappearance is still such a big mystery in the books, it’s super-exciting to me for him to pop up (the fact he wields a giant flaming sphere on a chain may also help). Still, he won’t be showing up anymore.

Daenerys is waiting for Jon when he returns to Eastwatch; she’s there when they crack him out of his frozen clothes and reveal his many chest wounds (and killer abs), and she’s there when he wakes up, on a ship bound for King’s Landing, along with the proof of the army of the dead. As pointed out by Tyrion to a scoffing Daenerys earlier, Jon really does look longingly at Dany, and her at him. His first words upon seeing her are “I’m sorry,” instantly comprehending her loss, but Daenerys knows that as painful as it was she needed to truly see what Westeros was facing. And that’s when Jon knows that Daenerys is his queen. When she asks about how his Northern lords will react, he tells her they’ll see her as he does, the real deal.

It may be a little pat, but I can totally buy Jon Snow pledging fealty to the woman he’s crushing on, especially after seeing her dragons. What I have a problem with is earlier in the episode, when Tyrion and Daenerys are having one of those little talks about how maybe Dany shouldn’t murder her way to the Iron Throne. Her repeated desire to be totally ruthless this season has been so weird after six seasons of compassion, as if she really wants to murder innocent people and Tyrion is just barely talking her out of it. Tyrion even reminds her that she said she wants to “break the wheel,” i.e. destroy the system of oppression pervading Westeros, and now she’s ready to butcher her way to the Iron Throne. I assume that Jon Snow’s doe eyes and utter belief in her goodness will go a long way to keeping on the straight and narrow.

But my problem with Daenerys is nothing compared to the problem I have with whatever the hell is going down in Winterfell. I know a stunning amount of people hate on Sansa, basically because she liked Joffrey back for a hot minute in season one. And I’m certain there are countless people who want Arya to kill her for maybe wanting to rule Winterfell instead of Jon. I assume Arya is reading all these same Reddit threads, because she is acting like Sansa is Walder goddamn Frey and it is bizarre.


Having found that note Sansa was forced/tricked/pressured by the Lannisters into sending Robb back in the day, Arya taunts her with it, deducing that Sansa’s afraid she’ll show it to the Northern lords, who will hate her for not… uh, choosing not to get tortured and die back when she was a 13-year-old. This is probably true, Sansa admits, given that the Lords change their minds about who they want to lead them every five minutes—plus, if they lose the lords Jon loses his army. This is very valid. Arya counters that Sansa’s just afraid of losing power, which is messed up. Again, is Sansa evil for wanting to rule? Does Arya really think Sansa would betray Jon to stay in charge? Maybe—maybe—she’d have a talk with him about how she’s good at ruling and likes it while Jon is terrible at ruling at dislikes it, so maybe she should stay Lady. In fact, since Jon left Winterfell at the first opportunity and has adamantly refused to go back, I think he’d be 100 percent down with that. But Sansa would never stage a coup, and we have no reason to think she would.

And yet Arya’s treating her like she found Sansa dropping poison in Jon’s drink. She’s belligerent, creepy, and talks about how she could kill her a lot in this episode, and it does not jibe at all with the fact Arya had a (reasonably) happy reunion with her sister like two-three episodes ago. Why is “The Lannisters made her do it” not an acceptable answer to her? Where is Bran during all this nonsense? Why does Littlefinger suggest Sansa have Brienne intercede if Arya might intend to harm her, when that sounds like that would actually defuse the situation? More importantly, where the hell is this storyline going? Is there any resolution here that’s going to be satisfying?

Probably not, but it’s tough to get too upset when I just saw two dragons destroy a couple thousand wights. Or knowing that next week, Jon Snow, Daenerys, and Cersei will all be in one location—meeting for the first time ever—along with countless others, as Jon shows them proof of the threat beyond the Wall, even if they’re going to be at the Wall very, very soon. Even then, I start to question how anyone—or at least Tyrion—would genuinely think Cersei would truly join in the fight against the Wight Walkers instead of using the war as a chance to betray them and further her own ambition, if she hasn’t set a full-on ambush at the meeting location. It just seems unrealistic that a single zombie would actually convince her to join forces with Daenerys and Jon Snow.

But you know what’s also unrealistic? Several hundred wights dragging a dead dragon out of an icy lake, then the Night’s King laying his hand upon its head, and its now ice-blue eyes shooting open. And maybe sometimes “zombie ice dragon” is the only answer you need.


Assorted Musings:

So at the end of the episode, it looks like Tormund and Beric stayed at Eastwatch, while Jon obviously went with Dany. We don’t see them, but I assume Jorah went with Dany too, and Gendry probably came along with Davos, who certainly came with Jon. Since the Hound put the wight on the boat, it seems like he’s probably coming with them, too. I don’t have any idea why he would travel with them unless, of course… he has tickets to CLEGANEBOWL.
Tyrion is very worried about the succession, which makes oodles of sense, given Daenerys’ penchant for riding her dragons into incredible danger. Dany is not so concerned… until she actually gets the throne. I find both sides valid.
Oh, Cersei sent an invite to Sansa to join her at King’s Landing for next week’s big meeting, but she sends Brienne off to go for her even after Littlefinger tells her to have Brienne keep Arya from murdering her. I understand none of this. Is she sending Brienne away to secretly thwart Littlefinger? Or is this somehow to be part of Littlefinger’s plan? Man, this storyline is a mess. 
Also: Why is Cersei the one sending the invites to this shindig? Dany’s the one who asked everyone to meet. You don’t tell one of the kids you invite to your birthday party to send all the other invites. I mean, I guess because if Jon or Daenerys were doing the invites they would have no need to send one to Winterfell, since Jon is already there, but this is ridiculous. I’d almost think Littlefinger sent the invite, but then, how would he know? His spies? Hmm… 
So as good of an idea as that may sound, I really don’t think Sansa and Arya are playing Littlefinger here, as much as I wish they were. Their scenes are by themselves, so there’s no reason to think they’re being watched, and thus pretending. At the very least, if they are conning Baelish, I think the reveal will feel pretty hokey. 
Tormund is the star of this episode, who was both super-gross and super-adorable, especially when he talked about his aspirations of making giant monster babies with Brienne that would take over Westeros.
As sloppy as things have gotten, I really thought the show was going to forget that the dead Thoros should turn into a wight. Thank goodness Jon remembered to burn the body. 
As soon as Jon said “Dany” I realized how long it’s been since someone on the show actually used that name. As Daenerys points out, the last person was Viserys, who was awful—bad company for Jon Snow. Or bloggers.
Quote of the episode, Sandor to Gendry (referring to Beric): “This one’s been killed six times you don’t hear him bitching about it.”
Last question: Where did the White Walkers get a bunch of enormous chains in the utter wilderness beyond the Wall? And if, as I suspect, they use Viserion’s fire to melt the Wall and break through next episode, how were they planning on getting through without a dragon?

Based on the impression that the party had travelled for a few days north of the wall, it would have taken Gendry a few days to return to Eastwatch. It would then have taken a raven several weeks to fly from Eastwatch to Dragonstone. It would have then, likewise, taken several weeks for the dragons to fly north. And then how long would it have taken Dany to find the party in the trackless wasteland north of the wall? 

Man. Well, Jon and his crew of frozen badasses have gotten their proof of the army of the dead, and Daenerys has seen for herself what danger lies beneath the Wall. But this was a pyrrhic victory at best, since Jon just handed the Night’s King his biggest weapon yet in the war to come. Also, Arya is sort of losing her mind and Sansa is not handling it well. Let’s all get into it in the comments!
