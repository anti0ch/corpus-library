/nYou Can Now Rent Scott Disick’s House for $90K a Month/nCorinne Olympios gave her fellow "Bachelor in Paradise" cast member DeMario Jackson a big hug when they supposedly ran into each other at a Los Angeles nightclub — after insiders told The National ENQUIRER that their alleged rape scandal was a ploy to bring in ratings! Corinne claimed that she was still a "victim" after ABC declared that video cleared DeMario of charges that he took advantage of her sexually while she was drunk. But now they've kissed and made up — just as sources predicted when talking to The ENQUIRER! “Reality TV contestants go into these shows with their wide eyes open, and nearly every company has them sign an indemnity clause to protect producers,” noted one reality-show veteran. “That way if someone regrets a hookup or gets a disease, nobody can hold the show responsible!” Another insider added that “no contestant complained about what went down. Staffers made all the noise.” Heavyweight lawyer Marty Singer, who represents the “Bachelor” contestant at the center of the supposed scandal, Corinne Olympios, confirms the show stirred the controversy. “It needs to be made crystal-clear that production of ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ was shut down because of multiple complaints received from “BIP” producers and crew members on the set," Singer said early in the controversy. “It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone.”/n'Bachelor In Paradise' Scandal — Happy Reunion For 'Victim' & 'Attacker!'/n"Tom has been seeing a few of the women in his life, including [ex-girlfriend] Missy [Tool], but hasn't rebounded with anyone in particular yet," an insider told Us Weekly.

Throughout their short time on the show, Nolan (who searched for love on Nick Viall‘s season of The Bachelor) and Peth (who previously competed on JoJo Fletcher‘s season of The Bachelorette) remained solid in their relationship — but not without some bumps along the way.During Tuesday’s episode, the couple found themselves discussing the possibly of pursuing their relationship outside of Paradise.

Once you get home, a big part of you just wants to stay home.”Of his relationship with Goode, Munson says while the two initially clicked, they just weren’t the right match.“I’m a pretty understated, mild-mannered guy — she’s over the top, she brings a lot of energy,” he says. “It was good for me to be woken up a little bit. … She’s a real girl, she gives it to you straight, and that was our common denominator initially, but pretty quickly I learned that we wouldn’t work out.”“Jasmine was someone who got me out of my comfort zone and who took that reluctance that I had toward being there and turned it into a willingness to be easy going and to see what Paradise would present to me,” he continued. “I think the only mistake I made was not just coming right out and being completely forthcoming with Jas and letting her know that I changed my mind about the direction we were heading in and that I wanted to see what else was out there for me.”FROM PEN: Why Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Didn’t Choose Peter Kraus  Though Munson returned briefly to hand out his rose to Goode so it wouldn’t go to waste, he knew their relationship was officially over: “I didn’t think we could co-exist much longer, being as it set off some sort of animosity between the two of them,” he said, referring to Goode and Whitney. “I didn’t want anything to do with that.”“I made sure that before I left — and this is God’s honest truth … I said, ‘I think it’s best for me to leave, but the only way I’m going to leave is if the two of them are going to stay,’ ” he continued. “I [told] producers, ‘I would like to leave, but they have to stay — that’s the only way I’m going.'”And while Goode was taken aback by Munson’s decision to leave the show, he maintains he was honest with her about how he had been feeling.“I made the comment to Jas probably 100 times that this wasn’t my favorite place to be, and in the end I was probably just going to lean toward leaving,” he said. “Jas said that ‘he never told me that he was going to leave’ — that’s the only gripe I have. I told Jas multiple times.”“She knew that I had thought about leaving on a daily basis,” he added. “So for her to say, ‘I never knew he wanted to leave’ … I know for sure that she knew that, which I kind of find strange — but it is what it is.”Bachelor in Paradise airs Mondays and Tuesdays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC./n Happy birthday, Jordan Rodgers!The Bachelorette season 12 winner turned 29 on Wednesday, and his fiancée JoJo Fletcher took to Instagram to celebrate the special day with an adorable post.“Happy Birthday to this gem of a human,” she gushed. “There are so many reasons why you deserve to be celebrated, not only today, but everyday!”“To name a few, thank you for always being my rock, for giving me a million laughs, for being a daily example of what it’s like to chase after dreams and never give up, for holding my hair back when I’ve had one too many rosès, for always dancing along side me when I embarrassingly try to, and of course, for loving me (& Jackie moon) with everything you have.

You don’t get there on day one or week one or week two, so you let it build up … and let it hit you.”Plus, the ladies wouldn’t have to worry about stacking up to attorney Lindsay.“I wouldn’t compare, because that’s not even fair to me or the person,” he said. “I would probably think about some of the things I went through, but I know how to get myself to open up, and if it’s the moment to find love, I’ll let it happen.”/nNow that Bachelor Nation has gotten over the initial shock of Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi‘s breakup, one question remains: What happens to her sparkler?Viewers watched Viall, 36, propose to Grimaldi, 29, with a 3.75-carat, round-cut diamond on the season finale of The Bachelor five months ago.“I just closed my eyes and just envisioned her beautiful face,” Viall told PEOPLE at the time. “I knew immediately which one was perfect for her.”Sadly, the couple ended their engagement Friday, and the glitzy ring’s fate is unknown even to its jeweler.“I make the rings with love and always hope for the best,” Neil Lane told PEOPLE in May, after previous Bachelor Ben Higgins and fiancée Lauren Bushnell called it quits. “But once I present the rings, I don’t know what happens to them afterwards if the couple breakup.

If love is a battlefield, love under public scrutiny is the Hunger Games.
Which is why Aaron Rodgers thinks he's better keeping his private life separate from his public life!
In an interview with ESPN Magazine, the Green Bay Packers star blamed a lack of privacy for putting an "increased strain" on his various relationships — including, presumably, his three-year romance with Olivia Munn.
Related: Aaron Comes To Colin Kaepernick's Defense!
Though the NFL star didn't mention the X-Men: Apocalypse actress by name, he referenced the horde of fans and commentators who questioned whether his then-girlfriend was hurting his football performance.
He explained: 
"When you are living out a relationship in the public eye, it's definitely … it's difficult. It has some extra constraints because you have other opinions about your relationship, how it affects your work and, you know, just some inappropriate connections."
Aside from his high-profile split earlier this year, the 33-year-old has faced scrutiny for other relationships — specifically, his estranged relationship with his family, which came to light in 2016 when Aaron's brother Jordan competed on (and won!) The Bachelorette.

The athlete has eluded commenting on how the ABC dating series depicted his family, but noted that whatever issues they need to work out shouldn't be done so in the public eye, admitting:
"A lot of people have family issues. I'm not the only one that does. It needs to be handled the right way."
In fact, keeping his personal relationships away from the limelight seems to make up his whole philosophy. He added:
"I think there should be a separation between your public life and your personal life. I've always just felt like there should be a time when you don't have to be on."
But don't worry, Rodgers isn't trying to keep everything hidden from his fans:
"I do have a desire to be myself and not have to feel like I've got to be so private."
It's OK to approach, Aaron — we won't bite!

Oh SHIT!
On Wednesday night, Corinne Olympios jumped in DeMario Jackson's arms and the two shared a kiss on the cheek for what was their first public reunion since all hell broke loose on Bachelor in Paradise earlier this summer.
The reality stars were photographed outside of Nightingale club in West Hollywood on Wednesday night. During the sighting, Corinne told paps: 
"Get a good shot, bitches."
Adding:
"We're friends! We never had bad blood."

Telling her side.
As you surely know, season four of Bachelor In Paradise almost didn't happen after allegations of sexual misconduct hit the set. At the time, it was believed that Corinne Olympios was too drunk to consent to a sexual encounter with BiP costar DeMario Jackson.
Related: Corinne Is More Successful Than Ever!
However, after Warner Bros. concluded an investigation into the matter, production resumed as everyone involved were cleared of any wrongdoing. Of course, this didn't stop the media from speculating about what exactly went down in Paradise — painting both Olympios and Jackson in poor lights.
That's why we were so interested in hearing Miz Olympios' side of the story during her sit down on BiP with Chris Harrison. Understandably, Nick Viall's ex was "really nervous" about the tell-all as it was her "first time talking about what happened." (Side Note: Remember this chat was filmed well before Corinne's Good Morning America interview.)
In regards to how she's doing post-scandal, the Bachelor season 21 villain was  "doing a lot better" as she had her mom to lean on during this time. Well that's good to hear.
After Harrison brought up the details which led to BiP's temporary halt in production, Corinne added:

"The first day, unfortunately, I don't remember much of. I definitely overdrank. I was also on some medication that you're not supposed to drink on… I am now weaning myself off that medication."

Now, before you jump to conclusions, Corinne explained that she hadn't been on the medication until AFTER her stint on the Bachelor and had never experienced a "blackout" on the prescription before the BiP incident. On why she may've seemed fine while filming, the Miami native shared:

"It can look like you're totally present and totally there, and your mind is just not anywhere near."

How scary. As for the morning after the encounter, Corinne said she laid in bed and thought:

"I just don't understand."

Oh, and the blonde businesswoman was quick to add that she has "no hard feelings" towards DeMario and stated that they went about their day "normally" the day after the incident. In fact, Corinne didn't even flinch when Harrison asked if she thought Jackson did anything wrong. She continued:

"I honestly don't think he did anything wrong. I don't think it's anyone's fault. It's just a really unfortunate, annoying situation that had to go down."

You can say that again. The reality TV vet then went on to blame the medication/alcohol combo once again for the disaster on set.
Also, Corinne made sure to wish DeMario well as she reiterated to the crowd:

"I don't blame DeMario. I don't even know what to call it. It's just so heart-sinking."

We're sure Rachel Lindsay's ex appreciates the support — albeit delayed.
Now, for what you've all been waiting for, the OTHER memorable moments from last night's showing of Paradise (below).
- Daniel Maguire arrived in Paradise following Matt Munson's exit and Lacey Mark was THRILLED about it. However, the professional Canadian wasn't as excited as he called Marks the "scraps" of Paradise. He then proceeded to flirt with Jasmine Goode and Christen Whitney.
-The rose ceremony took an inneresting turn when Matt returned to give Jasmine a rose… but still left the show. We guess he was trying to do the honorable thing?? In response to his kind gesture, Goode called Munson a "little bitch" to the cameras. Awkward.
-Here's how the rest of the rose ceremony went down: Jack Stone gave his rose to Christen. Derek Peth gave his rose to Taylor Nolan. Robby Hayes gave his rose to Amanda Stanton. Diggy Moreland gave his rose to Dominique Alexis. Adam Gottschalk gave his rose to Raven Gates. Ben Zorn gave his rose to Danielle Lombard. Dean Unglert gave his rose to Kristina Schulman. Thus, Alexis Waters and Sarah Vendal were sent packing.
-Dean later had a change of heart, which furthered his love triangle plot line, as he went on to make out with Danielle L. in the pool. Kristina responded by sobbing about the drama to Robby.
-Rachel Lindsay's Tickle Monster (whose real name is Dr. Jonathan Treece) arrived and whisked Christen off on a date. The twosome seemed to really hit it off, but upon their return, Whitney turned around and made out with Jack S. Dramaaaaa!

Cobb County, Georgia, police lieutenant Greg Abbott is under investigation after talking about killing "black people." Um, whut??
In a DUI arrest captured on dash cam, a white female passenger says she's afraid to reach for her cell phone because she's "seen way too many videos of cops…"

Abbott gets what she means right away and interrupts her, saying:

"But you're not black. Remember, we only kill black people."
What in the hell was he thinking?? He continues: 

"Yeah. We only kill black people, right? All the videos you've seen, have you seen the black people get killed?
Ugh. The incident is from way back in July 2016 but has only recently been released to the public. Abbott, who has been a police officer for 28 years and should know better, is now on "administrative duty" pending an investigation.
Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register released a statement saying:

"No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county."
Lt. Abbott has not spoken out about the incident, but his attorney, Lance LoRusso, released a statement on his behalf saying the comment was an unorthodox way to "de-escalate a situation involving an uncooperative passenger."

Even if it did work to de-escalate that situation (and frankly it seems like telling her only awful cops kill anyone would have been a more appropriate AND more calming thing to say), it is the kind of comment that escalates tension between the black community and police nationwide.

Chris Soules is heading to court in January for his fatal hit-and-run trial – and in the meantime he’s going to the Big Apple! RadarOnline.com has obtained exclusive documents that reveal the former star of The Bachelor has requested permission to travel to New York City.
“As a condition of Pretrial Release, Mr. Soules is prohibited from leaving the State of Iowa without written consent from the Court,” court papers obtained from Iowa District Court read. “Mr. Soules seeks the Court’s permission for a trip to New York City, New York, from September 7, 2017 through September 11, 2017.”
READ THE COURT PAPERS!
His legal team insisted that because he has maintained regular contact with his supervising probation officer, there should be no issues with him traveling out-of-state.
The court granted his request to travel. 
Although the request does not explain why he is traveling to New York City, it does fall during Fashion Week, which is from September 7 to September 13.
Soules, 35, was arrested on April 24 when he rear-ended the tractor of Kenneth Mosher, 66. Mosher was thrown into a ditch and died a short time later at a nearby hospital.
He was charged with leaving the scene of a deadly crash, resulting in death.

Alcoholic beverages and containers were found at the scene. He was caught on camera purchasing alcohol prior to the crash.
He entered a plea of not guilty on May 16.
Soules is expected to appear in court for the first day of his jury trial on January 18, 2018 at 9:30 a.m.
“The matter is expected to last four to five days,” the court papers read. “An initial pretrial conference will take place on November 16, 2017 at 1:30 p.m. A final pretrial conference will take place on January 4, 2018 at 1:30 p.m.”
