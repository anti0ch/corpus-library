/n‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7 Finale: See the Best Celebrity Reactions!/nWhat did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale?EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming. Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is “a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.” But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon?“I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind,” Headey said. “And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.”Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: “You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen. For a time. Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three. Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.”While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down. While we’re not touching that “more beautiful” bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow (er, Aegon Targaryen) and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead. “I think her lie will be very shocking,” Headey predicted. “She’s such a bitch. She’s so unforgiving of everybody.”Also check out Headey starring in a new Kasabian music video.Read our “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

In fact, following Sansa and Arya Stark’s epic bait and switch on Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish, the beloved HBO series’ very own Maisie Williams took to Twitter to share her thoughts on the explosive episode, and she summed it up rather perfectly.First, Williams, 20, retweeted a tweet she had posted in August 2016 instructing fans to begin emotionally readying themselves for season 7. Then she responded to herself with a classic J.

See you next year!/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” We suspected it was coming. We were nearly certain. So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along. Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark. But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North. But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne. And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all. And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow. He’s Aegon Targaryen. Yes, we’re still getting used to that too. Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon (though we’re also not entirely sure what an Aegon looks like).The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty. Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen (unless his brother, the doomed infant Aegon,* is also counted).Jon (we’re going to keep using that name for now) and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season. And it raises some big questions:1. Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim? (Emilia Clarke has strong feelings about this in our post-finale interview).2. Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all. Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later. It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.3. Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens (Daenerys is the product of incest herself). But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4. Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous (she believes she can’t after her child with Drogo was stillborn, the witch cursed her and she “birthed” three dragons instead). Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate?5. Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords. Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if/when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir. One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a “foreigner” like Daenerys.6. How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes. Even her own brothers.7. And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season?More “The Dragon and the Wolf” coverage:

— Game of Thrones podcast (finale episode coming Monday)* Confusing matters is the fact that Rhaegar had another son named Aegon with his previous wife Elia Martell. The infant Aegon, their other child, and Elia were all killed by Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegan during Robert’s Rebellion. These were the deaths that Prince Oberyn Martell was set on avenging during his all-too-brief time at King’s Landing before he was killed during a trial by combat.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/n WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.” Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish. The master of chaos, a climber of the ladders of power who finally reached for one rung too many. In trying to play Sansa and Arya Stark against one another (just as he once played their aunt Lysa against their mother Catelyn), the tactical manipulator laid bare his own villainy — especially with Bran Stark having access to all of space and time to probe his past. Littlefinger once aspired to reach the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. Now, like so many others who sought to rule, his life has been cut short — and by a woman he might have even truly loved.Below we spoke to Irish actor Aiden Gillan (The Wire, The Dark Knight Rises) about leaving the hit series after seven seasons of delivering a mesmerizing performance that humanized a character drawn with few redeeming qualities. The quiet, soft-spoken actor (I remember once finding him sitting quietly off by himself on the GoT set reading a David Foster Wallace book) doesn’t give interviews very often — Gillan generally prefers to let his performance speak for itself. And even during our chat he was reluctant to saying too much about his riveting final scene in Winterfell’s Great Hall lest his thoughts take something away from its impact. It’s perhaps the only trait Gillan shares with his nefarious character — he plays his cards close to his vest.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you get the infamous call?
AIDEN GILLAN: The infamous call. It’s so obvious what it is. [Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff] never ring you up — maybe once in six years. I learned about that call from [Roose Bolton actor Michael McElhatton] when he told me about his call and he talked about how it made him feel. And I thought if I get that call — or rather when as this has got to happen sooner or later to a character like Littlefinger — I wondered how it would make me feel. You start to think about because the show is such a part of your life for so many years. What will your life will be like outside of it? It’s a potent loss.So how did it make you feel?
You’re left a little bereft — for your character and for your experience. It also immediately makes you quantify the hugeness of what that experience has been over the last seven years, which has been massive.Did the showrunners joke around at all, or were they straightforward?
No joke. They just promised me a “river of blood.” Well, it wasn’t really a river of blood, but they promised me more than poor Michael got. It’s better to go out at the end of [the season] with a good arc then at the start of episode 2. Even if I’m only in a few episodes — like last season I probably had less than any season — once your character is established as part of the world people feel like you’re there all the time. So it’s not really an issue for me how many scenes I’m in as long as the scenes are good, and they’re well put together, and your contribution is good. Then people feel like you’re there al the time. I’m glad I had a good story to finish with.Littlefinger’s strategy in playing Arya against Sansa seemed really risky from the outset.
With carefully laid plans there’s always a bit of risk involved. He’s put himself in a situation that could backfire on him. I think he likes it. [His plans] are never fail safe. But he puts himself on the line like a good gambler.What was your reaction to the finale script?
Obviously, I was expecting it.But you didn’t know exactly how Littlefinger would go out, I assume.
Well, I did an interview with a publication [in 2015] and they asked me how I thought I would go. I said I thought Arya would deliver the blow. So it was as promised. And even within the scene, as soon as he walks in that room and Arya produces the dagger he knows the game is up. He at least suspected the game was up back in episode four when Bran told him, “Chaos is a ladder.” For Bran to come up with that is beyond coincidental. That’s when the ground started to shift beneath my feet. At that point, I knew the things I’ve done in private are not necessarily private.I haven’t seen your final scene but I’ve heard you’re fantastic in it, and that Littlefinger reveals some emotions that we haven’t really seen from him before. I don’t want to say too much about that. I don’t want to lay my cards on the table. I want to preserve that. There were more feelings for Sansa than I’ve let on the in the past. It becomes obvious. It’s an emotional farewell. And it’s a humiliating position to be in. He’s back in the sort of humiliating position that has been a driver for him: The rejection of Catelyn Stark, the humiliation by [Ned Stark’s older brother] Brandon Stark — back when he cut him from navel to collarbone and didn’t kill him [after their duel over Catelyn in their youth]. He’s put back in that position again.FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game 0f Thrones What was your last day like?
My last day on the set wasn’t that scene. [The execution] was the second scene I shot. I quite enjoyed doing things that way — shooting [Littlefinger’s death] and then shooting what comes before. When you know what’s coming you relax a little in the way you interact with the others. There’s something else that seeps into your performance — a kind of serenity. But yeah, I did find it quite emotional [shooting the finale scene]. And I don’t necessarily mean that I was sad, but it’s an emotional moment for the character so I felt what he was feeling. For the real last day at work Dan and David weren’t there but [co-executive producer] Bryan Cogman called people in and said a few words and my son was there with me. That was quite something. And I got my mockingbird pin. I had already let them know I wanted it, and I cleverly worked it so I got two. There’s one from my cloak and one from my tunic. So I got the large and the small size — one for me and one for my son.Was your favorite scene that one where Littlefinger gives a speech threatening Ros? You’ve mentioned that one a few times before.
It’s one of my favorite scenes. It was a good establisher in season 2 and we learn more about him in that. There were others I’ve enjoyed as much — probably the scene with Sansa in the courtyard where I kissed her while talking about her mother; that’s where we start to see how this is all mixed up in his head. I’ve continued to try to bring a bit of warmth and affability to a character who is shadowy, villainous and even treacherous. I thought it was my job to try to make people like him.Ultimately one could say it’s better to be the climactic death of the season 7 finale than potentially one of several major events within the final season, right?
You know, I did pretty well. The character did pretty well. They need to hone [the cast] down. That’s not an issue, really. The end is when it happens. I don’t think beyond that.More “The Dragon and the Wolf ” coverage:

Emilia Clarke. How do you think Daenerys Targaryen is going to react in the final season of Game of Thrones to the rather stunning news that her lover Jon Snow is also her nephew?We asked the Game of Thrones star this question while she sat on folding chair amid the ancient Roman ruins of Italica outside Seville, Spain last fall. The production used the historical location for King’s Landing’s famed Dragonpit in Sunday’s emotional finale, “The Dragon and the Wolf.”Clarke paused, considering. Then she loudly cried: “Ewwwww!” and laughed. “I think that’s how it’s going to go. I get the toothbrush—” she pretended to frantically brush her tongue.It was a hilarious reaction that underscores the rather seriously emotional game-changing revelation that threatens to shake up the final season of Game of Thrones.I pointed out that Daenerys has presumably long assumed she’ll avoid her family’s long predilection for incest. “Exactly!” Clarke says. “And then I walked back into it.”And what about the fact that Jon Snow — er, Aegon Targaryen — has a better claim to the Iron Throne than she does?“I’ve worked so hard, I don’t want to share that throne,” she replied. “No. The throne’s big enough for one dragon bum, and that’s mine. That’s it!”FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game of Thrones For costar Kit Harington, his main concern was figuring out how to realistically ramp up their romance with each of their pivotal scenes across four episodes — which led to some amusing behind the scenes debate.“Usually you go into a movie and meet [your costar] for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time,” Harington says. “But if you’ve known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we’re both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, ‘What’s the sexual tension in this scene?’ and she’s like, ‘Stop talking about sexual tension!’ It’s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.”Concurs Clarke: “Yeah [I would say], ‘Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don’t keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time,’” and added about the scene itself: “I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it’s a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.”The turning point for Daenerys, Clarke notes, was when Jon left her to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight. “She’s just like: Why don’t I want you do go? Why don’t I want you— doooooon’t fall for him. Don’t do it! There’s a battle going in on herself.”As for Harington’s reaction to his character’s parentage news next season, the actor would only say, “I said to Emilia it’s going to be a really cool scene when they find out.”And how will the reveal impact their relationship?“That part of it, I can’t predict,” he says. “It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other.”More “The Dragon and the Wolf ” coverage:

The Game of Thrones season seven finale was satisfying for many reasons, but none more than the episode's title teased us about.
After (seemingly) uniting the Houses together to fight against the army of the dead, Fire finally laid with Ice. The Dragon danced with the wolf. Daenerys Targaryen climbed Mt. Jon Snow, and he in return took a plunge into her dragon pit — and it was GLORIOUS.
Not as glorious, however, when considering that Westeros' hottest love scene played out while fans were reminded that the two characters are actually aunt and nephew!

Though fans may have made peace with the fact that Jon and Dany are secretly related, the characters have a lot to be nauseated about. At least, that's what Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington teased would be the response after the Targaryen truth bomb gets dropped in season eight.
Speaking to EW, Clarke considered her character's reaction to the news that she was fucking her own fire and blood, laughing: 
"Ewwwww! I think that's how it's going to go. I get the toothbrush—"
Well, we can't really blame her, can we? Especially given the fact that Jon Snow's true identity — Aegon Targaryen — now threatens Dany's claim to the Iron Throne.
In the finale, it was revealed (again) that Jon/Aegon's parents Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were secretly married, making him the true heir to rule Westeros.
According to Clarke, that's going to put quite the spike in the new relationship — because Dany ain't about to share:
"I've worked so hard, I don't want to share that throne. No. The throne's big enough for one dragon bum, and that's mine. That's it!"
Loverboy Harington wasn't as concerned with the impending doom of Jon and Dany as for how to realistically ramp up their chemistry during their short time together over the past four episodes.

Speaking on the pressure to play out the biggest romance of the series, he explained:
"Usually you go into a movie and meet [your costar] for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time. But if you've known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we're both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, ‘What's the sexual tension in this scene?' and she's like, ‘Stop talking about sexual tension!' It's a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching."
Clarke had more confidence in their palpable chemistry, adding:
"Yeah [I would say], ‘Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don't keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time… I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it's a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep."
Yep! Clark notes the big realization for Dany was when Jon left Dragonstone to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight:
"She's just like: Why don't I want you do go? Why don't I want you— doooooon't fall for him. Don't do it! There's a battle going in on herself."
As for Jon's reaction to learning who he truly is — and who he's truly banging — Harington would only say:
"I said to Emilia it's going to be a really cool scene when they find out."
But as for what they'll do after they find out, only the writers know! He added:
"That part of it, I can't predict. It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other."
Seeing as this is Game of Thrones, we already know which tragic end to expect. So let's enjoy the ride while we still can — we know Jon and Dany sure are!

[This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!]
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup. Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.
Related: There's Sexy Jon Snow Halloween Costume…
Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan. Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself (below)! 
Queen vs. Queen vs. King

Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north. Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons. We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister. But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co. could see for themselves that wights are indeed real. Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish

Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn. As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters. Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was (once again) trying to use her. Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason. In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble. It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat. Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
/n

Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode. Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

What did YOU think of the finale?? Be sure to share your thoughts (below)!
/n

Cobb County, Georgia, police lieutenant Greg Abbott is under investigation after talking about killing "black people." Um, whut??
In a DUI arrest captured on dash cam, a white female passenger says she's afraid to reach for her cell phone because she's "seen way too many videos of cops…"

Abbott gets what she means right away and interrupts her, saying:

"But you're not black. Remember, we only kill black people."
What in the hell was he thinking?? He continues: 

"Yeah. We only kill black people, right? All the videos you've seen, have you seen the black people get killed?
Ugh. The incident is from way back in July 2016 but has only recently been released to the public. Abbott, who has been a police officer for 28 years and should know better, is now on "administrative duty" pending an investigation.
Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register released a statement saying:

"No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county."
Lt. Abbott has not spoken out about the incident, but his attorney, Lance LoRusso, released a statement on his behalf saying the comment was an unorthodox way to "de-escalate a situation involving an uncooperative passenger."

Even if it did work to de-escalate that situation (and frankly it seems like telling her only awful cops kill anyone would have been a more appropriate AND more calming thing to say), it is the kind of comment that escalates tension between the black community and police nationwide.
See the shocking moment (below):

Tom has an explanation for that, and also some thoughts on why the King of the North and the Dragon Queen hooking up isn't that big of a deal ... even if she's his aunt.

The owner of Big D's Burgers sued Game claiming the joint is out $8,500 for unpaid catering services for a Fourth of July party. A rep for Big D's tells us Game hired the restaurant on 2 separate occasions and each time Game paid cash. The rep says Game requested food for up to 250 partygoers. But the rep says about 450 people showed up, forcing Big D's to make a food run. What's more ... the rep says he was told to also grab booze and cleaning supplies, which wasn't part of the deal but agreed to buy and bring back anyway. When it came time to pay Big D's, the rep says Game promised to wire the money the next day ... but the dough never came. We reached out to Game, and his manager Wack 100 tells TMZ the rapper never had a contract with Big D's and says they thought the company catered the party for free./nAllen Iverson didn't play in the BIG3 championship in  Vegas, but he was still trying to go home a winner ... 'cause the Answer hit up the roulette tables right after the game. TMZ Sports obtained photos of the the 3's Company player /coach betting away at the high limit roulette tables at the MGM Grand Saturday night. The sign on the table shows a $100 minimum and he appears to have a fat stack of black chips in front of him. Iverson's been casino hoppin' throughout the BIG3 tour -- he was spotted gambling in Philly and Chicago. He was suspended for missing a game earlier this season ... and we got photos showing him on a gambling run around the time he was supposed to be in Dallas. No word on how long Iverson's Vegas gambling binge lasted -- but we're told he was only at THIS roulette table for a short period of time. There were reports Iverson's been dealing with gambling issues in the past ... but he's publicly denied having a problem./nWHO'S THE ROOKIE NOW?! Von Miller got smashed on by rookie lineman Garett Bolles in a competitive game of mini-basketball in the Broncos locker room ... with Bolles tearing the rim down in the process! FYI, Bolles was the guy who wussed out during the rookie hot dog eating contest and got the  "Game of Thrones " shame treatment from his teammates when he spit out his wieners. Despite dominating the 1-on-1 ... Bolles ended up getting shamed -- AGAIN -- and it's hilarious. Von doesn't care about losing. He's still Von Miller. /nIn-N-Out is going all animal (style) on Smashburger for peddling a burger it considers triple the cheese, and double the theft ... so In-N-Out's suing. In-N-Out just filed suit against its burger rival for allegedly jacking their double-double, triple-triple and quad-quad concepts, and tweaked it with their own version -- 3 cheese slices and 2 patties, or as they call it ... the Triple Double. I-N-O acknowledges it didn't specifically trademark the name Triple Double -- although it claims its patrons are known to customize orders with similar terms. But in the suit, it says Smash's move is causing confusion in the marketplace and screwing with their burger biz. We've reached out to Smash for comment ... so far, no word back./nEzekiel Elliott's date with the arbitrator is here -- the Dallas Cowboys running back is set to appear at NFL headquarters in NYC Tuesday to appeal his 6 game domestic violence suspension.Elliott has adamantly denied physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson, despite the results of the NFL's private investigation into the matter.  Elliott will plead his case to arbitrator Harold Henderson -- the same arbitrator who heard Adrian Peterson's appeal in his child abuse suspension and Greg Hardy's appeal in his domestic violence suspension.  FYI, Henderson shot down Peterson's appeal -- but reduced Hardy's suspension from 10 games to 4.  Elliott will be represented by Jeffrey Kessler -- the same guy who repped Tom Brady in the DeflateGate appeal. Kessler got the initial 4 game suspension overturned in arbitration before the NFL went to court and had the suspension reinstated.  If Elliott's suspension is upheld, it's not the end of the road for the RB -- he's expected to continue the fight by filing a lawsuit in federal court.  Stay tuned ... /n'Game of Thrones' Star Tom Hopper Doesn't Mind Jon Snow and Daenerys Incest/nMarshawn Lynch: Hey Mom, Gimme a Hug!!!  /nThe Game Sued for Skipping on $8,500 Burger Tab, Game Calls BS/nAllen Iverson Bets Stacks at High Limit Roulette After BIG3 Championship Game/nVon Miller Gets Posterized By Rookie in Locker Room Basketball/nIn-N-Out Sues Smashburger for Playing 'Double-Double' Name Game/nEzekiel Elliott vs. NFL, Showdown Begins In Dom.
