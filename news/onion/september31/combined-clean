Corinne Olympios gave her fellow Bachelor in Paradise cast member DeMario Jackson a big hug when they supposedly ran into each other at a Los Angeles nightclub — after insiders told The National ENQUIRER that their alleged rape scandal was a ploy to bring in ratings! Corinne claimed that she was still a victim after ABC declared that video cleared DeMario of charges that he took advantage of her sexually while she was drunk.
But now they've kissed and made up — just as sources predicted when talking to The ENQUIRER! Reality TV contestants go into these shows with their wide eyes open, and nearly every company has them sign an indemnity clause to protect producers, noted one reality-show veteran.
That way if someone regrets a hookup or gets a disease, nobody can hold the show responsible! Another insider added that no contestant complained about what went down.
Staffers made all the noise.
Heavyweight lawyer Marty Singer, who represents the Bachelor contestant at the center of the supposed scandal, Corinne Olympios, confirms the show stirred the controversy.
It needs to be made crystal-clear that production of Bachelor in Paradise was shut down because of multiple complaints received from BIP producers and crew members on the set, Singer said early in the controversy.
It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone.

Tom has been seeing a few of the women in his life, including ex-girlfriend Missy Tool, but hasn't rebounded with anyone in particular yet, an insider told Us Weekly.
Still, another source claimed Tom and Missy are just friends.
According to the first insider, Tom isn’t commenting on the failed marriage until Luann airs her side of the story.
The former Countess first TV interview regarding the divorce airs September 6 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.
He didn't want to do any interviews until he sees Luann's sit-down with Andy to see if she bad-mouths him, the source told Us.
Tom is really trying to take the high road with the divorce.
In a clip from the upcoming interview, Luann opens up about a fight she had with Tom in NYC restaurant.
According to reports, Luann slapped him, but Luann told Andy all she did was grab his face.
It was in the heat of the moment.
I was hurt about something.
I wanted his attention, so I grabbed his face.
It wasn't really a slap, Luann said.
The source close to Tom, however, claims the incident was much worse: Tom said he was bleeding from the face and that really pushed the divorce forward because it became physical.

This week, the two just happened to run into one another after a night out at Nightingale Plaza in Hollywood.
DeMario looked very happy to see her, and in one instance, it looks like they nearly kissed!
Corinne jumped on him as he held her tight.
They even said they were suddenly friends again.
Guess an apology works miracles.
Earlier this week, on Tuesday’s episode of Bachelor in Paradise, Corinne, 24, spoke in her first televised interview about the incident that was talked about around the world.
I would want to tell him, Listen, I respect you as a human, she told Chris Harrison.
I have nothing against you.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this.
I know what it feels like.
I’m sorry.
 I don’t blame DeMario, Corinne added.
I never pointed fingers at DeMario.
As reported, Corinne and DeMario got caught up in a scandal after engaging in a sexual encounter in a pool that crew members deemed inappropriate.
After further investigation, it was determined there was no wrongdoing.
Corinne also revealed to People that she was on medication at the time and believes alcohol mixed with the medicine negatively affected her.
The only regret I have is letting myself drink too much — that’s it…It was unfortunate.
But you know what, I’m an adult and I have to move past it.

Corinne looked amazing in a short black skirt, purple top, and black high heeled boots.

During her interview with Chris, Corinne admitted her mom was staying with her but that every day she's doing a lot better.

Everyone saw this coming.
Nick and Vanessa have been having problems since the very beginning.
They fought all the time, a source told the mag.
Vanessa and Nick announced their split earlier this week, nearly six months after the airing of their proposal on The Bachelor finale.
Vanessa was completely underwhelmed by Nick and never wanted to settle down with him, the insider dished.
And Nick is still basically a player and not that mature.
He was bored with Vanessa.
Despite the couple claiming they were in the love, the source said they both had ulterior motives staying in the relationship as long as they did.
They’re both desperate to be famous, said the insider.

They found love in paradise!
Taylor Nolan and Derek Peth got engaged during the taping of Bachelor in Paradise’s aftershow on Wednesday, PEOPLE confirms.
The duo, who met on the fourth season of BiP, hit it off from the start.
Throughout their short time on the show, Nolan and Peth remained solid in their relationship — but not without some bumps along the way.
During Tuesday’s episode, the couple found themselves discussing the possibly of pursuing their relationship outside of Paradise.
When Nolan expressed her concerns, Peth responded with, F— you, which did not sit well with the mental health counselor.
However, love seemed to trump all, because the two moved past the drama and worked things out.
In June, production on season 4 was temporarily suspended after two producers voiced concern about Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson’s sexual encounter.
Warner Brothers later determined no misconduct had occurred.

I’m in Miami.
She’s in Dallas, Abasolo said.
We love L.A. We just want to be together.
We’re not a fan of long distance, added Lindsay, admitting that though they haven’t decided on a definitive place yet, they definitely want to relocate soon.
Though they haven’t set a wedding date, they do have a timeline in mind: The two are aiming for late 2018 or early 2019, as Lindsay wants a winter wedding.
We’re going to be together, and I’m going to wake up next to this woman for the rest of my life, Abasolo said.
That’s something that I’m going to cherish.
We can’t focus on anything that anybody else says on the outside.
Our life is our life.
Love is love for us, Lindsay added.
For us, we have to be strong for each other if this is going to work.
Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson are moving on from their Bachelor in Paradise sex scandal … together.
The reality stars put on a show for paparazzi outside of Nighingale in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, with Olympios jumping into Jackson’s arms and playfully planting a kiss on his cheek.
Its a stark contrast to the serious tone of their separate sit-downs with Chris Harrison addressing the production shutdown earlier on BiP.
Still, both parties insisted though they hadn’t seen each other since hooking up in Mexico, they wished each other well.
It’s just really hard, and I hope that he’s doing better, Olympios told Harrison through tears on Tuesday’s episode.
I really just want people to know that I don’t blame DeMario.
I never pointed fingers at DeMario.
I never said a bad word about DeMario.
In June, production on season 4 was temporarily suspended after two producers voiced concern about Olympios and Jackson’s encounter.
Warner Brothers later determined no misconduct had occurred.
RELATED VIDEO: Corinne Olympios Discusses BiP Sex Scandal in Emotional InterviewOlympios recently told PEOPLE that she regrets mixing medication with alcohol that ill-fated night.
As for Jackson?I’m still going to be me, he said.
I’m working very hard on just building back up my spirits.
This summer took a lot out of me.
I’m not going to let this get me down.
I’m never going to stoop down and I’m never going to be something they want me to be.
I’m going to be who I am and that’s my whistleblowing, crazy, fun-loving self.

If we had to sum up this season of Bachelor in Paradise in two words, it’d probably be love triangles.
This week’s triangle, of course, resulted in the sudden departure of the man involved, Matt Munson, who opted to leave the show amid the ongoing drama between two contestants he was seeing, Jasmine Goode and Christen Whitney.
During an appearance on The Rose Buds podcast on Tuesday, the 32-year-old construction sales rep opened up about his decision to bow out, admitting that he was hesitant about the entire experience from the beginning.
When I first got there, I was a bit reluctant, said Munson, who made it to the final six on Rachel Lindsays season of The Bachelorette.
I didn’t know I really wanted to be there in Mexico after all that had happened on Rachel’s season, he added.
You go through a lot on The Bachelorette, you form a relationship with a really great girl and a lot of good guys, and it takes a lot of energy.
Once you get home, a big part of you just wants to stay home.
Of his relationship with Goode, Munson says while the two initially clicked, they just weren’t the right match.
I’m a pretty understated, mild-mannered guy — she’s over the top, she brings a lot of energy, he says.
It was good for me to be woken up a little bit.
… She’s a real girl, she gives it to you straight, and that was our common denominator initially, but pretty quickly I learned that we wouldn’t work out.
Jasmine was someone who got me out of my comfort zone and who took that reluctance that I had toward being there and turned it into a willingness to be easy going and to see what Paradise would present to me, he continued.
I think the only mistake I made was not just coming right out and being completely forthcoming with Jas and letting her know that I changed my mind about the direction we were heading in and that I wanted to see what else was out there for me.
FROM PEN: Why Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Didn’t Choose Peter Kraus  Though Munson returned briefly to hand out his rose to Goode so it wouldn’t go to waste, he knew their relationship was officially over: I didn’t think we could co-exist much longer, being as it set off some sort of animosity between the two of them, he said, referring to Goode and Whitney.
I didn’t want anything to do with that.
I made sure that before I left — and this is God’s honest truth … I said, I think it’s best for me to leave, but the only way I’m going to leave is if the two of them are going to stay, he continued.
I told producers, I would like to leave, but they have to stay — that’s the only way I’m going.
And while Goode was taken aback by Munson’s decision to leave the show, he maintains he was honest with her about how he had been feeling.
I made the comment to Jas probably 100 times that this wasn’t my favorite place to be, and in the end I was probably just going to lean toward leaving, he said.
Jas said that he never told me that he was going to leave — that’s the only gripe I have.
I told Jas multiple times.
She knew that I had thought about leaving on a daily basis, he added.
So for her to say, I never knew he wanted to leave … I know for sure that she knew that, which I kind of find strange — but it is what it is.
Bachelor in Paradise airs Mondays and Tuesdays on ABC.
Happy birthday, Jordan Rodgers!
The Bachelorette season 12 winner turned 29 on Wednesday, and his fiancée JoJo Fletcher took to Instagram to celebrate the special day with an adorable post.
Happy Birthday to this gem of a human, she gushed.
There are so many reasons why you deserve to be celebrated, not only today, but everyday!
To name a few, thank you for always being my rock, for giving me a million laughs, for being a daily example of what it’s like to chase after dreams and never give up, for holding my hair back when I’ve had one too many rosès, for always dancing along side me when I embarrassingly try to, and of course, for loving me with everything you have.

This amazing woman I get to call mine surprised me this weekend for my Birthday.
I am not easy to surprise, and somehow she managed to sneak my brother and two of my best friends into town without me knowing for a huge family and friend birthday dinner.
I love her more than anything, she is the most thoughtful, loving, selfless person I know! She continues to amaze me and I am blessed beyond belief to have her in my life.
However bub….
you set the bar pretty high for #30 next year A post shared by Jordan Rodgers on Aug 29, 2017 at 5:23pm PDTThis amazing woman I get to call mine surprised me this weekend for my birthday, he wrote.
I love her more than anything, she is the most thoughtful, loving, selfless person I know! She continues to amaze me and I am blessed beyond belief to have her in my life.
However bub … you set the bar pretty high for #30 next year.
The couple, who celebrated their 1-year engagement anniversary in May, are currently enjoying life together in Fletcher’s hometown of Dallas, Texas.
And while they’re happy as ever, they’re not in any rush to tie the knot.
I think in the beginning you feel pressured to set a wedding date, Fletcher, 26, told PEOPLE earlier this month.
But when you get comfortable, you realize that this isn’t something that you need to feel pressure on.
I think a lot of people are excited to ask about it and talk about it and I’m more than willing to talk about it because it’s also exciting for me to think about, she continued.
We don’t feel the pressure of just setting a date, getting married — we’re really taking our time and enjoying each other.
This could really be the most dramatic Bachelor reveal ever.
Fans favor Bachelorette runner-up Peter Kraus, but he may not be ready to walk down the aisle.
Season 20’s leading man Ben Higgins ended his engagement and remains open to a second chance … just not quite yet.
Baby-faced Dean Ulgert is facing backlash for playing the field on Bachelor in Paradise.
Speaking of which, BiP bartender and Snapchat recap extraordinaire Wells Adams could be dating contestant Danielle Maltby.
And newly single former Bachelor Nick Viall? A fifth time on the franchise seems unlikely.
Which bring us to another of Rachel Lindsays exes: the always charming Eric Bigger, who fell in love for the first time on The Bachelorette.
In an interview with PEOPLE Now, Bigger confirmed ABC hasn’t reached out to him about becoming The Bachelor … but he didn’t rule it out, either.
No, I haven’t been approached, he said, adding with a laugh, The universe is approaching me.
Everyone’s talking about it!
FROM PEN: Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay & Bryan Abasolo Open Up About Wedding Plans & How Many Kids They Want!
Bigger, 29, thinks he’d offer Bachelor Nation something special.
I haven’t really watched too much of the past Bachelors, but I don’t know, I just think I just bring a different dynamic and different energy, he said.
And you want to have fun, you want to find love, but at the same time it’s a process.
You don’t get there on day one or week one or week two, so you let it build up … and let it hit you.
Plus, the ladies wouldn’t have to worry about stacking up to attorney Lindsay.
I wouldn’t compare, because that’s not even fair to me or the person, he said.
I would probably think about some of the things I went through, but I know how to get myself to open up, and if it’s the moment to find love, I’ll let it happen.
Now that Bachelor Nation has gotten over the initial shock of Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldis breakup, one question remains: What happens to her sparkler?Viewers watched Viall, 36, propose to Grimaldi, 29, with a 3.
75-carat, round-cut diamond on the season finale of The Bachelor five months ago.
I just closed my eyes and just envisioned her beautiful face, Viall told PEOPLE at the time.
I knew immediately which one was perfect for her.
Sadly, the couple ended their engagement Friday, and the glitzy ring’s fate is unknown even to its jeweler.
I make the rings with love and always hope for the best, Neil Lane told PEOPLE in May, after previous Bachelor Ben Higgins and fiancée Lauren Bushnell called it quits.
But once I present the rings, I don’t know what happens to them afterwards if the couple breakup.
I think the ring goes to ring heaven.

If love is a battlefield, love under public scrutiny is the Hunger Games.
Which is why Aaron Rodgers thinks he's better keeping his private life separate from his public life!
In an interview with ESPN Magazine, the Green Bay Packers star blamed a lack of privacy for putting an increased strain on his various relationships — including, presumably, his three-year romance with Olivia Munn.
Related: Aaron Comes To Colin Kaepernick's Defense!
Though the NFL star didn't mention the X-Men: Apocalypse actress by name, he referenced the horde of fans and commentators who questioned whether his then-girlfriend was hurting his football performance.
He explained: 
When you are living out a relationship in the public eye, it's definitely … it's difficult.
It has some extra constraints because you have other opinions about your relationship, how it affects your work and, you know, just some inappropriate connections.
Aside from his high-profile split earlier this year, the 33-year-old has faced scrutiny for other relationships — specifically, his estranged relationship with his family, which came to light in 2016 when Aaron's brother Jordan competed on The Bachelorette.

The athlete has eluded commenting on how the ABC dating series depicted his family, but noted that whatever issues they need to work out shouldn't be done so in the public eye, admitting:
A lot of people have family issues.
I'm not the only one that does.
It needs to be handled the right way.
In fact, keeping his personal relationships away from the limelight seems to make up his whole philosophy.
He added:
I think there should be a separation between your public life and your personal life.
I've always just felt like there should be a time when you don't have to be on.
But don't worry, Rodgers isn't trying to keep everything hidden from his fans:
I do have a desire to be myself and not have to feel like I've got to be so private.
It's OK to approach, Aaron — we won't bite!
Oh SHIT!
On Wednesday night, Corinne Olympios jumped in DeMario Jackson's arms and the two shared a kiss on the cheek for what was their first public reunion since all hell broke loose on Bachelor in Paradise earlier this summer.
The reality stars were photographed outside of Nightingale club in West Hollywood on Wednesday night.
During the sighting, Corinne told paps: 
Get a good shot, bitches.
Adding:
We're friends! We never had bad blood.

DeMario was all smiles but later joked:
My PR is gonna hate this in the morning.
Take a look for yourself!!
A post shared by E! News on Aug 31, 2017 at 5:25am PDT
Do you think this is real or all a show?? SOUND OFF in the comments!
Telling her side.
As you surely know, season four of Bachelor In Paradise almost didn't happen after allegations of sexual misconduct hit the set.
At the time, it was believed that Corinne Olympios was too drunk to consent to a sexual encounter with BiP costar DeMario Jackson.
Related: Corinne Is More Successful Than Ever!
However, after Warner Bros.
concluded an investigation into the matter, production resumed as everyone involved were cleared of any wrongdoing.
Of course, this didn't stop the media from speculating about what exactly went down in Paradise — painting both Olympios and Jackson in poor lights.
That's why we were so interested in hearing Miz Olympios side of the story during her sit down on BiP with Chris Harrison.
Understandably, Nick Viall's ex was really nervous about the tell-all as it was her first time talking about what happened.
In regards to how she's doing post-scandal, the Bachelor season 21 villain was doing a lot better as she had her mom to lean on during this time.
Well that's good to hear.
After Harrison brought up the details which led to BiP's temporary halt in production, Corinne added:
The first day, unfortunately, I don't remember much of.
I definitely overdrank.
I was also on some medication that you're not supposed to drink on… I am now weaning myself off that medication.
Now, before you jump to conclusions, Corinne explained that she hadn't been on the medication until AFTER her stint on the Bachelor and had never experienced a blackout on the prescription before the BiP incident.
On why she may've seemed fine while filming, the Miami native shared:
It can look like you're totally present and totally there, and your mind is just not anywhere near.
How scary.
As for the morning after the encounter, Corinne said she laid in bed and thought:
I just don't understand.
Oh, and the blonde businesswoman was quick to add that she has no hard feelings towards DeMario and stated that they went about their day normally the day after the incident.
In fact, Corinne didn't even flinch when Harrison asked if she thought Jackson did anything wrong.
She continued:
I honestly don't think he did anything wrong.
I don't think it's anyone's fault.
It's just a really unfortunate, annoying situation that had to go down.
You can say that again.
The reality TV vet then went on to blame the medication/alcohol combo once again for the disaster on set.
Also, Corinne made sure to wish DeMario well as she reiterated to the crowd:
I don't blame DeMario.
I don't even know what to call it.
It's just so heart-sinking.
We're sure Rachel Lindsay's ex appreciates the support — albeit delayed.
Now, for what you've all been waiting for, the OTHER memorable moments from last night's showing of Paradise.
Daniel Maguire arrived in Paradise following Matt Munson's exit and Lacey Mark was THRILLED about it.
However, the professional Canadian wasn't as excited as he called Marks the scraps of Paradise.
He then proceeded to flirt with Jasmine Goode and Christen Whitney.
The rose ceremony took an inneresting turn when Matt returned to give Jasmine a rose… but still left the show.
We guess he was trying to do the honorable thing?? In response to his kind gesture, Goode called Munson a little bitch to the cameras.
Awkward.
Here's how the rest of the rose ceremony went down: Jack Stone gave his rose to Christen.
Derek Peth gave his rose to Taylor Nolan.
Robby Hayes gave his rose to Amanda Stanton.
Diggy Moreland gave his rose to Dominique Alexis.
Adam Gottschalk gave his rose to Raven Gates.
Ben Zorn gave his rose to Danielle Lombard.
Dean Unglert gave his rose to Kristina Schulman.
Thus, Alexis Waters and Sarah Vendal were sent packing.
Dean later had a change of heart, which furthered his love triangle plot line, as he went on to make out with Danielle L.
in the pool.
Kristina responded by sobbing about the drama to Robby.
Rachel Lindsay's Tickle Monster arrived and whisked Christen off on a date.
The twosome seemed to really hit it off, but upon their return, Whitney turned around and made out with Jack S.
Dramaaaaa!

Abbott gets what she means right away and interrupts her, saying:
But you're not black.
Remember, we only kill black people.
What in the hell was he thinking?? He continues: 
Yeah.
We only kill black people, right? All the videos you've seen, have you seen the black people get killed?
Ugh.
The incident is from way back in July 2016 but has only recently been released to the public.
Abbott, who has been a police officer for 28 years and should know better, is now on administrative duty pending an investigation.
Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register released a statement saying:
No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county.
Lt.
Abbott has not spoken out about the incident, but his attorney, Lance LoRusso, released a statement on his behalf saying the comment was an unorthodox way to de-escalate a situation involving an uncooperative passenger.

Tom has been seeing a few of the women in his life, including ex-girlfriend Missy Tool, but hasn't rebounded with anyone in particular yet, an insider told Us Weekly.
Still, another source claimed Tom and Missy are just friends.
According to the first insider, Tom isn’t commenting on the failed marriage until Luann airs her side of the story.
The former Countess first TV interview regarding the divorce airs September 6 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.
He didn't want to do any interviews until he sees Luann's sit-down with Andy to see if she bad-mouths him, the source told Us.
Tom is really trying to take the high road with the divorce.
In a clip from the upcoming interview, Luann opens up about a fight she had with Tom in NYC restaurant.
According to reports, Luann slapped him, but Luann told Andy all she did was grab his face.
It was in the heat of the moment.
I was hurt about something.
I wanted his attention, so I grabbed his face.
It wasn't really a slap, Luann said.
The source close to Tom, however, claims the incident was much worse: Tom said he was bleeding from the face and that really pushed the divorce forward because it became physical.

Corinne Olympios Apologizes To DeMario Jackson After BIP Sex Scandal
They found love in paradise!
Taylor Nolan and Derek Peth got engaged during the taping of Bachelor in Paradise’s aftershow on Wednesday, PEOPLE confirms.
The duo, who met on the fourth season of BiP, hit it off from the start.
Throughout their short time on the show, Nolan and Peth remained solid in their relationship — but not without some bumps along the way.
During Tuesday’s episode, the couple found themselves discussing the possibly of pursuing their relationship outside of Paradise.
When Nolan expressed her concerns, Peth responded with, F— you, which did not sit well with the mental health counselor.
However, love seemed to trump all, because the two moved past the drama and worked things out.
In June, production on season 4 was temporarily suspended after two producers voiced concern about Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson’s sexual encounter.
Warner Brothers later determined no misconduct had occurred.

Game of Thrones Season 7 Finale: See the Best Celebrity Reactions!
What did Cersei Lannister really think of Daenerys Targaryen when she walked up to her in the Dragonpit during Sunday’s Game of Thrones finale?EW was on the set last November for the filming of the epic meeting in Spain and we asked actress Lena Headey during a break in filming.
Obviously, Cersei was shooting some major eye daggers at the Mother of Dragons, then afterward she snarked to Tyrion that Dany is a foreign whore who doesn’t know her place.
But what was running through her mind in the photo above after Dany landed on Drogon?I think she’s immediately envious because Daenerys is more beautiful and younger than she is and the prophecy says somebody younger and more beautiful will take her place so I’m sure that’s at the forefront of her mind, Headey said.
And Tyrion is her Hand, so she couldn’t be any worse.
Ah, yes, the prophecy! Maggy the Frog’s prediction to a teenage Cersei during the flashback that kicked off season 5: You’ll never wed the prince.
You’ll wed a king … You’ll be queen.
For a time.
Then comes another — younger, more beautiful — to cast you down and take all that you hold dear … The king will have 20 children, you’ll have three.
Gold will be their crowns; gold their shrouds.
While prophecies have a spotty track record on GoT, every piece of Maggy’s prediction has so far come true — except for the line about somebody casting her down.
While we’re not touching that more beautiful bit (plenty of Cersei fans would disagree with Headey’s comparative modesty, now with Jaime Lannister leaving Cersei to help fight the Army of the Dead, it certainly seems like another part of the prophecy may be coming true.
FROM PEN: The Red Wedding Is Still One Of Game Of Thrones Biggest Game Changing MomentsWe also asked Headey about Cersei’s big lie — pledging to help Jon Snow and Dany combat the Night King while scheming to build up her forces to crush them instead.
I think her lie will be very shocking, Headey predicted.
She’s such a bitch.
She’s so unforgiving of everybody.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
After months of mounting anticipation and intense fan theorizing, the Game of Thrones season 7 finale has come and gone Happy tweeting, Thrones fans.
See you next year!
WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
We suspected it was coming.
We were nearly certain.
So perhaps the biggest twist of the Game of Thrones season 7 finale was that there was no twist at all with respect to Jon Snow’s parentage: The details the series held back confirming were precisely what fans had figured all along.
Jon Snow is not a Stark, nor even a bastard, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was legitimately married to Lyanna Stark.
But now that Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly know this too and are preparing to tell Jon Snow, the reveal has massive implications for the show’s eighth and final season.
Let’s break this down: The reveal means Jon Snow has no business whatsoever being King in the North.
But it means he has every right to sit on the Iron Throne.
And it means Daenerys is not the true heir at all.
And it means the man just had #BoatSex with his aunt.
It also means Jon Snow’s name isn’t actually Jon Snow.
He’s Aegon Targaryen.
Yes, we’re still getting used to that too.
Let’s face it, he doesn’t exactly look like an Aegon.
The name Aegon has a long history with the Targaryen dynasty.
Jon Snow would actually be Aegon VI Targaryen.
Jon and Daenerys will surely learn this news early next season.
And it raises some big questions:1.
Will Daenerys accept Jon as legitimate? Will she throw aside her long-time goal and support Jon’s claim?.
Does Jon want to be the king of Westeros? It doesn’t seem like something he’d aspire to be, but, then again, he spent his whole life believing he wasn’t entitled to anything at all.
Might Jon, instead, continue to support Daenerys despite having the better claim? It seems most likely they’ll take a page from the Dragonpit summit and continue to focus on the problem at hand — defeating the Night King — with an eye toward figuring out who gets the throne later.
It’s also very possible one or both will be killed before they have to make that final decision.
Will Dany and Jon halt their romance when they learn they’re related? Incest isn’t viewed with quite the same level of disgust and criminality in Westeros as in our own world — especially among Targaryens.
But it’s still rather frowned upon and it’s hard to imagine these two characters being all that thrilled about it.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game Of Thrones 4.
Will Dany get pregnant? Dany has long said she can’t have children, but her reasoning for this is tenuous.
Could she be wrong? And could having a child keep Jon and Dany’s romance going if they otherwise would want to separate?5.
Who will rule House Stark and the North? This one seems easy: Sansa, who already has the backing of some of the lords.
Also, selling the unification of the North and Dany’s team might be a bit easier if/when Jon — who the Stark bannerman like and respect — is revealed to be the Iron Throne heir.
One figures they’d be more likely to rally behind a Northern-raised Stark ward with an Iron Throne claim than a foreigner like Daenerys.
How will Cersei react to all of this? Presumably, it won’t change her feelings one bit — they’re all traitors in her eyes.
Even her own brothers.
And most pressing of all: How are we going to wait a year or even more for the final season?More The Dragon and the Wolf coverage:

The infant Aegon, their other child, and Elia were all killed by Ser Gregor The Mountain Clegan during Robert’s Rebellion.
These were the deaths that Prince Oberyn Martell was set on avenging during his all-too-brief time at King’s Landing before he was killed during a trial by combat.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
The master of chaos, a climber of the ladders of power who finally reached for one rung too many.
In trying to play Sansa and Arya Stark against one another, the tactical manipulator laid bare his own villainy — especially with Bran Stark having access to all of space and time to probe his past.
Littlefinger once aspired to reach the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side.
Now, like so many others who sought to rule, his life has been cut short — and by a woman he might have even truly loved.
Below we spoke to Irish actor Aiden Gillan about leaving the hit series after seven seasons of delivering a mesmerizing performance that humanized a character drawn with few redeeming qualities.
The quiet, soft-spoken actor doesn’t give interviews very often — Gillan generally prefers to let his performance speak for itself.
And even during our chat he was reluctant to saying too much about his riveting final scene in Winterfell’s Great Hall lest his thoughts take something away from its impact.
It’s perhaps the only trait Gillan shares with his nefarious character — he plays his cards close to his vest.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you get the infamous call?
AIDEN GILLAN: The infamous call.
It’s so obvious what it is.
Showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff never ring you up — maybe once in six years.
I learned about that call from Roose Bolton actor Michael McElhatton when he told me about his call and he talked about how it made him feel.
And I thought if I get that call — or rather when as this has got to happen sooner or later to a character like Littlefinger — I wondered how it would make me feel.
You start to think about because the show is such a part of your life for so many years.
What will your life will be like outside of it? It’s a potent loss.
So how did it make you feel?
You’re left a little bereft — for your character and for your experience.
It also immediately makes you quantify the hugeness of what that experience has been over the last seven years, which has been massive.
Did the showrunners joke around at all, or were they straightforward?
No joke.
They just promised me a river of blood.
Well, it wasn’t really a river of blood, but they promised me more than poor Michael got.
It’s better to go out at the end of the season with a good arc then at the start of episode 2.
Even if I’m only in a few episodes — like last season I probably had less than any season — once your character is established as part of the world people feel like you’re there all the time.
So it’s not really an issue for me how many scenes I’m in as long as the scenes are good, and they’re well put together, and your contribution is good.
Then people feel like you’re there al the time.
I’m glad I had a good story to finish with.
Littlefinger’s strategy in playing Arya against Sansa seemed really risky from the outset.
With carefully laid plans there’s always a bit of risk involved.
He’s put himself in a situation that could backfire on him.
I think he likes it.
His plans are never fail safe.
But he puts himself on the line like a good gambler.
What was your reaction to the finale script?
Obviously, I was expecting it.
But you didn’t know exactly how Littlefinger would go out, I assume.
Well, I did an interview with a publication in 2015 and they asked me how I thought I would go.
I said I thought Arya would deliver the blow.
So it was as promised.
And even within the scene, as soon as he walks in that room and Arya produces the dagger he knows the game is up.
He at least suspected the game was up back in episode four when Bran told him, Chaos is a ladder.
For Bran to come up with that is beyond coincidental.
That’s when the ground started to shift beneath my feet.
At that point, I knew the things I’ve done in private are not necessarily private.
I haven’t seen your final scene but I’ve heard you’re fantastic in it, and that Littlefinger reveals some emotions that we haven’t really seen from him before.
I don’t want to say too much about that.
I don’t want to lay my cards on the table.
I want to preserve that.
There were more feelings for Sansa than I’ve let on the in the past.
It becomes obvious.
It’s an emotional farewell.
And it’s a humiliating position to be in.
He’s back in the sort of humiliating position that has been a driver for him: The rejection of Catelyn Stark, the humiliation by Ned Stark’s older brother Brandon Stark — back when he cut him from navel to collarbone and didn’t kill him after their duel over Catelyn in their youth.
He’s put back in that position again.
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game 0f Thrones What was your last day like?
My last day on the set wasn’t that scene.
The execution was the second scene I shot.
I quite enjoyed doing things that way — shooting Littlefinger’s death and then shooting what comes before.
When you know what’s coming you relax a little in the way you interact with the others.
There’s something else that seeps into your performance — a kind of serenity.
But yeah, I did find it quite emotional shooting the finale scene.
And I don’t necessarily mean that I was sad, but it’s an emotional moment for the character so I felt what he was feeling.
For the real last day at work Dan and David weren’t there but co-executive producer Bryan Cogman called people in and said a few words and my son was there with me.
That was quite something.
And I got my mockingbird pin.
I had already let them know I wanted it, and I cleverly worked it so I got two.
There’s one from my cloak and one from my tunic.
So I got the large and the small size — one for me and one for my son.
Was your favorite scene that one where Littlefinger gives a speech threatening Ros? You’ve mentioned that one a few times before.
It’s one of my favorite scenes.
It was a good establisher in season 2 and we learn more about him in that.
There were others I’ve enjoyed as much — probably the scene with Sansa in the courtyard where I kissed her while talking about her mother; that’s where we start to see how this is all mixed up in his head.
I’ve continued to try to bring a bit of warmth and affability to a character who is shadowy, villainous and even treacherous.
I thought it was my job to try to make people like him.
Ultimately one could say it’s better to be the climactic death of the season 7 finale than potentially one of several major events within the final season, right?
You know, I did pretty well.
The character did pretty well.
They need to hone the cast down.
That’s not an issue, really.
The end is when it happens.
I don’t think beyond that.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers from the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
So.
Emilia Clarke.
How do you think Daenerys Targaryen is going to react in the final season of Game of Thrones to the rather stunning news that her lover Jon Snow is also her nephew?We asked the Game of Thrones star this question while she sat on folding chair amid the ancient Roman ruins of Italica outside Seville, Spain last fall.
The production used the historical location for King’s Landing’s famed Dragonpit in Sunday’s emotional finale, The Dragon and the Wolf.
Clarke paused, considering.
Then she loudly cried: Ewwwww! and laughed.
I think that’s how it’s going to go.
I get the toothbrush— she pretended to frantically brush her tongue.
It was a hilarious reaction that underscores the rather seriously emotional game-changing revelation that threatens to shake up the final season of Game of Thrones.
I pointed out that Daenerys has presumably long assumed she’ll avoid her family’s long predilection for incest.
Exactly! Clarke says.
And then I walked back into it.
And what about the fact that Jon Snow — er, Aegon Targaryen — has a better claim to the Iron Throne than she does?I’ve worked so hard, I don’t want to share that throne, she replied.
No.
The throne’s big enough for one dragon bum, and that’s mine.
That’s it!
FROM PEN: Expect the Unexpected When It Comes to Game of Thrones For costar Kit Harington, his main concern was figuring out how to realistically ramp up their romance with each of their pivotal scenes across four episodes — which led to some amusing behind the scenes debate.
Usually you go into a movie and meet your costar for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time, Harington says.
But if you’ve known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we’re both kind of freaking out about it.
I would be like, What’s the sexual tension in this scene? and she’s like, Stop talking about sexual tension! It’s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.
Concurs Clarke: Yeah I would say, Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don’t keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time, and added about the scene itself: I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it’s a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.
The turning point for Daenerys, Clarke notes, was when Jon left her to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight.
She’s just like: Why don’t I want you do go? Why don’t I want you— doooooon’t fall for him.
Don’t do it! There’s a battle going in on herself.
As for Harington’s reaction to his character’s parentage news next season, the actor would only say, I said to Emilia it’s going to be a really cool scene when they find out.
And how will the reveal impact their relationship?That part of it, I can’t predict, he says.
It could be them walking off into the sunset.
It could be them killing each other.

The Game of Thrones season seven finale was satisfying for many reasons, but none more than the episode's title teased us about.
After uniting the Houses together to fight against the army of the dead, Fire finally laid with Ice.
The Dragon danced with the wolf.
Daenerys Targaryen climbed Mt.
Jon Snow, and he in return took a plunge into her dragon pit — and it was GLORIOUS.
Not as glorious, however, when considering that Westeros hottest love scene played out while fans were reminded that the two characters are actually aunt and nephew!

Though fans may have made peace with the fact that Jon and Dany are secretly related, the characters have a lot to be nauseated about.
At least, that's what Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington teased would be the response after the Targaryen truth bomb gets dropped in season eight.
Speaking to EW, Clarke considered her character's reaction to the news that she was fucking her own fire and blood, laughing: 
Ewwwww! I think that's how it's going to go.
I get the toothbrush—
Well, we can't really blame her, can we? Especially given the fact that Jon Snow's true identity — Aegon Targaryen — now threatens Dany's claim to the Iron Throne.
In the finale, it was revealed that Jon/Aegon's parents Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark were secretly married, making him the true heir to rule Westeros.
According to Clarke, that's going to put quite the spike in the new relationship — because Dany ain't about to share:
I've worked so hard, I don't want to share that throne.
No.
The throne's big enough for one dragon bum, and that's mine.
That's it!
Loverboy Harington wasn't as concerned with the impending doom of Jon and Dany as for how to realistically ramp up their chemistry during their short time together over the past four episodes.

Speaking on the pressure to play out the biggest romance of the series, he explained:
Usually you go into a movie and meet your costar for the first time and you develop that chemistry over that time.
But if you've known somebody for seven years and shared this incredible journey in your own lives together … we're both kind of freaking out about it.
I would be like, What's the sexual tension in this scene? and she's like, Stop talking about sexual tension! It's a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.
Clarke had more confidence in their palpable chemistry, adding:
Yeah I would say, Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don't keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time… I love that when we get to the saucy stuff it's a beautiful acceptance of a wordless … yep.
Yep! Clark notes the big realization for Dany was when Jon left Dragonstone to journey beyond The Wall to capture the wight:
She's just like: Why don't I want you do go? Why don't I want you— doooooon't fall for him.
Don't do it! There's a battle going in on herself.
As for Jon's reaction to learning who he truly is — and who he's truly banging — Harington would only say:
I said to Emilia it's going to be a really cool scene when they find out.
But as for what they'll do after they find out, only the writers know! He added:
That part of it, I can't predict.
It could be them walking off into the sunset.
It could be them killing each other.
Seeing as this is Game of Thrones, we already know which tragic end to expect.
So let's enjoy the ride while we still can — we know Jon and Dany sure are!
This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup.
Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.

Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan.
Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself! 
Queen vs.
Queen vs.
King
Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north.
Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons.
We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister.
But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co.
could see for themselves that wights are indeed real.
Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish
Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn.
As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters.
Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was trying to use her.
Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason.
In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble.
It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat.
Boy, bye!
Theon Steps Up
Another Game Of Thrones season has come and gone!
And, in typical stan fashion, numerous viewers took to Twitter throughout the finale to weigh in on moments from the highly anticipated episode.
Now, as this season has been chock-full of surprises, we knew The Dragon and the Wolf would give fans a lot to talk about online.

Cobb County, Georgia, police lieutenant Greg Abbott is under investigation after talking about killing black people.
Um, whut??
In a DUI arrest captured on dash cam, a white female passenger says she's afraid to reach for her cell phone because she's seen way too many videos of cops…
Related: Aaron Rodgers Defends Colin Kaepernick's Police Brutality Protesting
Abbott gets what she means right away and interrupts her, saying:
But you're not black.
Remember, we only kill black people.
What in the hell was he thinking?? He continues: 
Yeah.
We only kill black people, right? All the videos you've seen, have you seen the black people get killed?
Ugh.
The incident is from way back in July 2016 but has only recently been released to the public.
Abbott, who has been a police officer for 28 years and should know better, is now on administrative duty pending an investigation.
Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register released a statement saying:
No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county.
Lt.
Abbott has not spoken out about the incident, but his attorney, Lance LoRusso, released a statement on his behalf saying the comment was an unorthodox way to de-escalate a situation involving an uncooperative passenger.

Even if it did work to de-escalate that situation, it is the kind of comment that escalates tension between the black community and police nationwide.

Police Officer Under Investigation After Telling Woman Not To Worry, We Only Kill Black People'
The guy who played Dickon Tarly on Game of Thrones ain't bothered by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen's incest in the finale, cause it was inevitable.
We got Tom Hopper at LAX - but before we got to Jon and Dany, we had to know, why no shirtless scenes from his buff character before meeting his fate, courtesy of dragon's breath.
Tom has an explanation for that, and also some thoughts on why the King of the North and the Dragon Queen hooking up isn't that big of a deal, even if she's his aunt.
His theory has more to do with the plot leading up to that big reveal, but still, Tom seems down.
Forget Skittles, the one thing Marshawn Lynch needs before a game is big ol squeeze from his mom, and he got it in Dallas! Mama Lynch was on the field while the Raiders were warming up to play the Cowboys on Saturday, and decided to show a little love to his biggest fan in the world.
It's a sweet moment - and the least scary we've ever seen him on the football field!  BTW, good form from Mama Lynch, gotta wrap up!  Always hug your Mama.

The Game hired a burger joint to cater his shindig, but went radio silent when it came time to pay the piper, so says the owner suing the rapper, but Game says the owner's lying her ass off.
The owner of Big D's Burgers sued Game claiming the joint is out $8,500 for unpaid catering services for a Fourth of July party.
A rep for Big D's tells us Game hired the restaurant on 2 separate occasions and each time Game paid cash.
The rep says Game requested food for up to 250 partygoers.
But the rep says about 450 people showed up, forcing Big D's to make a food run.
What's more, the rep says he was told to also grab booze and cleaning supplies, which wasn't part of the deal but agreed to buy and bring back anyway.
When it came time to pay Big D's, the rep says Game promised to wire the money the next day, but the dough never came.
We reached out to Game, and his manager Wack 100 tells TMZ the rapper never had a contract with Big D's and says they thought the company catered the party for free.
Allen Iverson didn't play in the BIG3 championship in  Vegas, but he was still trying to go home a winner, cause the Answer hit up the roulette tables right after the game.
TMZ Sports obtained photos of the the 3's Company player /coach betting away at the high limit roulette tables at the MGM Grand Saturday night.
The sign on the table shows a $100 minimum and he appears to have a fat stack of black chips in front of him.
Iverson's been casino hoppin throughout the BIG3 tour - he was spotted gambling in Philly and Chicago.
He was suspended for missing a game earlier this season, and we got photos showing him on a gambling run around the time he was supposed to be in Dallas.
No word on how long Iverson's Vegas gambling binge lasted - but we're told he was only at THIS roulette table for a short period of time.
There were reports Iverson's been dealing with gambling issues in the past, but he's publicly denied having a problem.
WHO'S THE ROOKIE NOW?! Von Miller got smashed on by rookie lineman Garett Bolles in a competitive game of mini-basketball in the Broncos locker room, with Bolles tearing the rim down in the process! FYI, Bolles was the guy who wussed out during the rookie hot dog eating contest and got the Game of Thrones shame treatment from his teammates when he spit out his wieners.
Despite dominating the 1-on-1, Bolles ended up getting shamed - AGAIN - and it's hilarious.
Von doesn't care about losing.
He's still Von Miller.
In-N-Out is going all animal on Smashburger for peddling a burger it considers triple the cheese, and double the theft, so In-N-Out's suing.
In-N-Out just filed suit against its burger rival for allegedly jacking their double-double, triple-triple and quad-quad concepts, and tweaked it with their own version - 3 cheese slices and 2 patties, or as they call it, the Triple Double.
I-N-O acknowledges it didn't specifically trademark the name Triple Double - although it claims its patrons are known to customize orders with similar terms.
But in the suit, it says Smash's move is causing confusion in the marketplace and screwing with their burger biz.
We've reached out to Smash for comment, so far, no word back.
Ezekiel Elliott's date with the arbitrator is here - the Dallas Cowboys running back is set to appear at NFL headquarters in NYC Tuesday to appeal his 6 game domestic violence suspension.
Elliott has adamantly denied physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson, despite the results of the NFL's private investigation into the matter.
Elliott will plead his case to arbitrator Harold Henderson  - the same arbitrator who heard Adrian Peterson's appeal in his child abuse suspension and Greg Hardy's appeal in his domestic violence suspension.
FYI, Henderson shot down Peterson's appeal - but reduced Hardy's suspension from 10 games to 4.
Elliott will be represented by Jeffrey Kessler  - the same guy who repped Tom Brady in the DeflateGate appeal.
Kessler got the initial 4 game suspension overturned in arbitration before the NFL went to court and had the suspension reinstated.
If Elliott's suspension is upheld, it's not the end of the road for the RB - he's expected to continue the fight by filing a lawsuit in federal court.
Stay tuned,

A group of guys became a dog’s saving grace this week in Lumberton, Texas.
On Monday, Bandit the dog found himself caught in the raging flood waters of Hurricane Harvey.
He was moments from being washed far away from his home when a group of volunteer rescuers, made up mostly of local teenagers, stepped in.
The video of the daring save was posted by one of the rescuers, Kavan Wise, on Facebook, where it has over 270,000 views.
In the clip, you can see the group lowering someone into the fast moving water by a rope.
This individual plucks Bandit out of the rapids, and then is pulled back to safety.
Casey Fredrick, Bandit’s owner, posted on Twitter that she was very thankful to the teenagers that saved her dog.
Fredrick also shared a video of Bandit safe and singing on a blanket after the rescue.

For thousands of displaced people in southeast Texas, it’s still too early to tell how severely their homes and businesses have been impacted by Hurricane Harvey.
But as residents grapple with the devastating disaster, some lawmakers and lawyers are urging them to file their home owners insurance claims quickly Opponents of the law argue it will allow insurance companies to get away with wrongdoing without being held accountable, and that by reducing the penalty insurers would have to pay for delays, it will make it more difficult for homeowners to get payments on time.
There is nothing about this bill that helps policyholders, Will Adams, vice president of legislative affairs for the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, told the Dallas Morning News.
Everything about this bill makes it harder for policyholders to hold insurance companies accountable.
But defenders of the law argue it still protects the rights of the homeowner.
And it’s not clear whether claims over Harvey’s damage will actually be affected by the new law.
Mark Hanna, of the Insurance Council of Texas, which strongly backed the legislation, told MONEY that claims made before or after Friday would be treated the same way, since the new law does not affect the claims process — only the lawsuits that derive from claims.
The new law does not change the filing process for a claim from current law, nor does it address how the insurer must handle that claim.
RELATED VIDEO: US Coast Guard Continues to Receive Upwards of 1,000 Calls per Hour From Flood Stranded Harvey VictimsAdditionally, said Joe Woods, vice president of state government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, most of these claims will be flood claims, and therefore would not be affected by the law.
Of those non-flood claims, he added, an even smaller fraction would eventually end up in a lawsuit.
The new law will not apply to most claims or lawsuits arising from Harvey, because most of the policyholders claims will be for damage caused by flooding, Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which supports the new law, said in a statement.
These claims will be made under the federal flood insurance program and governed by federal law.
There's some misinformation about #HB1774's effect on consumers, the claims process, and consumer's ability to sue.
Here's the facts: and 5 Really Mean?To learn more about how you can help those impacted by Harvey, check out MONEY’s list of charities you can donate to.
Additionally, be wary of scammers using Harvey to develop fake charitable organizations and crowdfunding efforts to exploit those impacted by the devastating event.

, which runs the plant 25 miles northeast of Houston, said in a release they were notified of two explosions and black smoke at the site by Harris County Emergency Operations at about 2 a.m. local time.
They added there was a risk of further explosions at the facility.
The company explained that despite following their hurricane preparation plan and setting up an evacuation zone in an area 1.
5 miles from the plant, extreme flooding affected the facility which makes organic peroxides used in the production of plastic resins, paints and other products.
However, unprecedented flooding overwhelmed our primary power and two sources of emergency backup power, they said.
As a result, we lost critical refrigeration of the products on site.
Some of our organic peroxides products burn if not stored at low temperature.

Firefighters evacuating us @nbc6 County Sheriff’s Office announced on Twitter that a deputy was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes from the plant.
Nine others sought medical care as a precautionary measure, but the office later announced that they believed they inhaled a non-toxic irritant.
Rep.
Ted Poe, who represents the district that includes the chemical plant, told ABC News, The worst-case scenario is that this chemical plant could explode.
Harvey, a record-shattering storm, touched down as a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, dumping several inches of rain on the Texas Coastal Bend.
The storm left homes flooded, many without power and several buildings destroyed.
Local officials reported 30 confirmed and suspected flood-related deaths according to the New York Times.
THANK YOU to our Oak Lake Pizza Hut team for their out-of-the-car response to deliver hot pizzas all day to the community they serve.
the midst of the deadly Texas floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, employees at a local Pizza Hut franchise made and delivered hot slices to those in need.
Shayda Habib, the manager of Pizza Hut in Oak Lake, and her employees rushed to their restaurant on Wednesday to hurriedly prepare food after hearing that families nearby were trapped in their homes and were running out of food.
When I heard there were families in need, I knew we needed to act fast, Habib told local Houston news outlet KPRC.
I called my husband and asked him to gather up kayaks and meet me at the restaurant.

We packed 120 pizzas into kayaks and took them out to people in their homes, Habib told The Houston Chronicle.
The people in the houses didn’t expect us to come.
It was so nice to see their smiles after so much gloom.
Habib said she plans on delivering more pizzas on Thursday or until the store runs out of food to deliver.
Pizza Hut thanked the team on Twitter, writing, THANK YOU to our Oak Lake Pizza Hut team for their out-of-the-car response to deliver hot pizzas all day to the community they serve.
Days after witnessing the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Sean Lowe is returning to the Houston area to further help victims affected by the natural disaster.
On Sunday, the Texas native was watching television at his home in Dallas when he sprang into action after seeing news coverage of Hurricane Harvey, which has left millions of people to battle catastrophic flooding.
Sunday was just a normal Sunday for us and I was watching some of the news coverage at home and then I started thinking about how Game of Thrones, the season finale was going to air that night.
I was kind of excited for Game of Thrones and then I went back to watch the news coverage and I thought You know what, this isn’t right.
I’m getting excited about watching this TV show when all these people are losing their homes, Lowe, 33, tells PEOPLE.
At that moment I just said I’m going to try to figure something out and I tweeted out if anyone had a boat.
That same day, Lowe picked up a boat from a woman who offered hers to the Bachelor alum.
He departed for the Houston area, but was forced to sleep at a gas station overnight before making it Monday to Katy, Texas, where he teamed up with his father’s friend.
A lot of Katy is under water, so that’s where we spent our day and we teamed up with some firefighters who were so happy to see an extra boat, because they desperately needed it, says Lowe.
We spent our day trying to collect as many people as we possibly could.
With a team of firefighters on board, the duo navigated the boat throughout Katy, helping anyone they could along the way.
He says there’s one specific moment from his day that he won’t ever be able to shake.
We were taking our boat down a residential street, which is kind of an eerie feeling on its own, and in the distance we saw people yelling out to us at 7:23pm PDTI told Catherine when I went down there the first time I was just going to be gone a day because I wanted to lend a helping hand and do my part and I was kind of amazed when I got back at the feeling that I had.
I thought that I would be satisfied — I did my part, says Lowe.
But I just got back home and I kept telling Catherine, I need to be back down there because they still need help.
 So since then I’ve been trying to coordinate everything and finally work out all the details where I can leave tomorrow morning and hopefully I’ll be down there for a few days.
This next trip’s kind of open-ended on my end, he explains.
I’m just going to try to help as much as I can and I’ll figure it out along the way.
During this difficult time, Lowe has been leaning on his faith.
You want to pray for the people of Houston and there is power in prayer — there’s no doubt about that, he shares.
Part of our faith is helping others, so I’m glad I have the chance to do that.
WATCH: Hurricane Harvey: Before and After Footage Shows Damage to HoustonThough Lowe witnessed an overwhelming amount of tragedy in Katy, he feels encouraged by the many volunteers who are helping those affected by the storm.
I just knew I needed to go down there and help my fellow Texans and do whatever I can.
It was so encouraging to get down there and see people from all over the state of Texas.
I’ve heard that many other people are coming in from other states — I don’t want to just say it was Texans.
But it’s really cool because we do have that state pride and strangers helping strangers, he says.
There’s something really beautiful about that and I’m just glad I was able to play a small part.
He is also imploring people nationwide to extend their support in any way they can.
Just because you can’t get to Houston, you can help in so many ways and I think it’s appreciated so much by everybody down there, he says.
Every little bit helps.
If you want to text the Red Cross for $10 or whatever it is, I know it’s appreciated.

A former contestant on NBC’s American Ninja Warrior was saved as floodwaters engulfed her home near Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, and she documented the rescue of her family—and their pig and three-legged dog—on Instagram.
Emergency rescue services arrived in a massive truck in front of Lisa Eicher’s home in Conroe, Texas, on the morning of August 28.
Her home is raised about 10-feet above ground to protect it from floods from a nearby lake, but the storm caused water to climb to their front steps, and neither Eicher nor her husband, Joey, had anticipated it rising as fast or ferociously as it did.
It didn’t feel real, it was like a dream, our backyard was a lake and the water was rising quickly up our steps, Eicher, 33, tells PEOPLE.
I was feeling panicked and I was trying to figure out what the hell we would do.
We've got two kids with Down syndrome, a three legged dog, and a pig.
All of whom will be freaked out.
I told the firefighter.
Perfect! He replied.
No one anticipated the water would rise as fast and as ferociously as it did.
When they pulled up they screamed, we have to get out now! We woke a still sleeping Ace and Archie, threw as much as we could in a garbage bag, and got out.
.
As they swam Penny the Pig out to the truck, one of the firemen said to me, you better be getting this on video, I assured him I was.
Comic relief was abundant.
They dropped us off at a nearby, dry gas station and headed back out to rescue more.
Joey had woken up in the middle of the night and drove our car to higher ground so a friend came and picked him up and they were able to get to it.
The kids and I sat in the only spot safe from rain in front of the gas station and waited.
The attendant came out and brought us all sandwiches and icees.
A sweet man insisted I take twenty dollars to buy something for the kids.
And a homeless couple brought us blankets.
Wanting nothing in return.
Countless people stopped to check on us and offer help.
We don't know what damage will be done to our house, we are worried.
But more than anything, we are overwhelmed by the kindness of people.
So many of you have offered to help, even offered to open your homes to us.
Thank you.
We are safe and sound at our good friends house.
.
My only regret is that I didn't charge people for selfies with Penny the Pig at the gas station.
We are lucky.
We are grateful.
Lots of love.
#eichertribe #harveyA post shared by Lisa Eicher on Aug 28, 2017 at 5:41pm PDTFirefighters called out to the family over the sound of the roaring waters, and Eicher and her husband gathered their four children—Sevy, 13, Archie, 13, Ace, 9, and Radko, 3—along with her three-legged dog, Pip, and 80-pound pig, Penny, to prepare them for evacuation.
I don’t get too panicked ever, but I was definitely nervous for my kids, Eicher says about watching the rushing water quickly rise further up their steps.
I knew it would be scary for them, so I tried to make it seem like it was something fun, and they followed my lead.
We were literally swimming and carrying them, we couldn’t even touch the ground.
Once the children were safe, a firefighter and Joey teamed up to carry their squealing pig through the water.
Another firefighter picked up their three-legged dog and helped him swim to the truck.
So last night we put Penny in the garage to keep her safe from the storm.
Her pen was already starting to flood.
This morning when we woke up without power, we realized she was trapped.
Couldn't open the garage doors, and couldn't get down the elevator to the garage.
There's a small garage door in the backyard that is manual, but unfortunately we didn't think to unlock it from the inside.
With no answers on when we would have power and the lake rising fast, we had to get her out before it was too late.
See the full rescue mission in my stories.
#harvey #pennythepig #comicreliefA post shared by Lisa Eicher on Aug 27, 2017 at 1:30pm PDT Left Pip's rescue out yesterday.
Some of you have asked about her.
So here's our brave girl.
We adopted her about a year ago and she had just lost her leg.
She's sure learned to get around just fine without it!  So thankful for these firefighters and how kind and loving they were with not only our kids but our pets too.
All is well here.
Happy to be with good friends and in dry clothes.
Tummies and hearts full.
#pipthetrip #harvey #eichertribe #wreckitradA post shared by Lisa Eicher on Aug 29, 2017 at 7:14am PDTThe rescuers dropped the family off at a nearby Valero gas station, where Eicher and her children rested on an air mattress while Joey went to reach their car, which he moved to higher ground the night before.
As they sat outside the station, a gas attendant offered them Subway sandwiches and iced drinks.
Another man offered Eicher $20 to spend on the children, and a homeless couple offered them blankets and waited with them until Joey got back.
It was crazy to see a number of people who came up to us and offered us help, Eicher says.
We didn’t have shoes on, some of my kids didn’t have pants on, it was a very scary and vulnerable situation, but having people check up on us lifted our spirits.
Things got scary.
We got rescued.
People are good.
#harvey #eichertribe A post shared by Lisa Eicher on Aug 28, 2017 at 8:20am PDTWhen Joey came back with the car, the family left town for Austin to stay with friends until the water recedes from their neighborhood.
The family doesn’t know how much damage the flood caused their home, and there’s no telling when they’ll be back.
But they have already shown the resilience to stick together and rebound when duty calls.
RELATED VIDEO: Texas Pair Give Free Haircuts to Hurricane Harvey EvacueesEicher was one of 120 people who tried out for American Ninja Warrior this season, after her daughter, Ace, suggested she try out.
I was so out of shape, I couldn’t even hang from a bar, let alone do a pull-up, Eicher recalls.
I just laughed it off.
But Ace kept insisting, and as time passed, Eicher realized that making it on to the show would get her into shape and help her raise awareness for Down syndrome and adoption.
Eicher kick-started her training near the end of 2016 and built a ninja course in the back yard.
Thanks to her dedication and support from her family, Either was invited to compete in San Antonio in March 2017.
She was disappointed when NBC didn’t choose to run her attempt, but when her daughter asked if she’d try it again next season, Eicher said she would.
I wanted to show my kids you could do anything you want, even if it seems completely ridiculous, Eicher says.
If you work hard enough, you can do crazy things you thought were impossible.
The bodies of an elderly couple and their four great-grandchildren were found after their family van was tragically swept away by Houston floodwaters into Greens Bayou on Sunday.
Manuel Saldivar, 84, and his wife Belia, 81, were driving with their great-grandchildren Sammy Saldivar, the son of Manuel and Belia Saldivar, was driving the vehicle when it plunged into the bayou, his brother Ric told CNN.
Sammy was able to get out of his seat belt and climb through the driver’s side window.
He clung to a branch for 45 minutes.
The water picked the van up, and it was just floating after that, Ric told ABC13.
It went head first in, and water came in real fast.
According to the Washington Post, Sammy told Ric he attempted to open the door to let Manuel and Belia out — but it wouldn’t budge.
He was yelling at the kids to climb out of the back of the van; I’m sure they couldn’t reach it, Ric told the outlet.
He could hear the kids screaming but couldn’t push the doors open.
That’s what he keeps hearing in his head.
And the van just went underwater and was gone.
WATCH: Texans Band Together Amid Catastrophic FloodingBy the time sheriff’s deputies came along and threw him a rope, it was too late.
A friend and coworker of the family set up a GoFundMe page to assist the family with funeral arrangements.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Gonzales said that if rescuers have leads on missing persons or come across a body in the rising floodwaters — to report it immediately to authorities.
If you find a body please call 911 and report it, secure it as best as you can, if you feel comfortable with it, he said.
Some folks have tied a body to a tree and it’s very graphic to say it.
But that’s the reality we’re living in right now.

Six Family Members Found Dead in Van After Being Swept Away by Harvey Flood: Our Worst Fears Have Been Realized’
This week, Texas saw disappointment and disaster like no other… when Donald Trump tried to turn a crowd of devastated flood victims into a re-election rally.
Sure, the president's cartoonish charisma may have picked up the morale — that's his version of Barack Obama's human empathy, after all — but it looks like he also exaggerated how deep he plunged into the wreckage.
After leaving Houston, POTUS tweeted a message of support to the people of Texas, saying he witnessed the devastation left by the Hurricane Harvey first hand.
Related: Conservative Blogger's Tweet Sparks Viral Meme!
Okay, seems fair.
We saw him down there speaking to crowds.
Maybe this one tweet is genuine and not completely fabricated?
LOL… yeah right! One of the responses came from White House correspondent Andrew Beatty, who claimed he traveled with the president — and clarified they didn't come close to anything he would consider calling a first hand experience: 
After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!
I traveled with the President yesterday.
Personally, I would not claim to have seen Harvey's horror and devastation first hand.
Now, that's more like it!
We don't know what's worse: Trump not giving a shit about the honesty of his tweets, or him actually believing he saw the worst parts of the flood.
Because sadly, both scenarios are just as likely to be possible.
It might just be because we see her on TV everyday, but it appears Ellen DeGeneres hasn't aged since her talk show began in 2003.
And after discovering what she looked like as a teen, we can confirm the comedianne has access to the fountain of youth.

As several celebs have shown over the past couple days, disasters bring out the best in people.
Sadly, they also bring out the worst.
On Monday night, climate change denier Ann Coulter tweeted:
I don't believe Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for Houston electing a lesbian mayor.
But that is more credible than climate change.

Yeah.
Gross.
Related: Coulter's Twitter Beef With Delta Airlines
It seems obvious to us she's not so much trying to give credence to the insipid notion that natural disasters are caused by homosexuality but rather to say that climate change is an even crazier idea.
But putting such a disgusting homophobic notion on the same playing field as something that is real and measurable and endangering our planet is just too gross to deal with.
So we'll let Twitter handle it! See some of the best responses to one of the worst sentiments!

I don't think Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for us electing an idiot president.

Best Buy is in hot water over a store accidentally upselling… well, hot water!
The company issued an apology after a viral photo taken at a Houston location showed a case of water selling for over $40 amid Hurricane Harvey.
Video: Joel Osteen Tries To Clear His Name Amid Hurricane Drama!
The photo of 24-packs of bottled water being sold at a cool $42.
96 was shared to Twitter on Tuesday, causing users to accuse the retail giant of price gouging in the wake of severe flooding and devastation brought on by the storm: 
One Houston resident sent me a pic of water he saw being sold for *$42* at a nearby Best Buy.
They were kind enough to offer $29 bottles too 
But apparently, the not-so-best price was merely a mistake made by some of the company's employees.
Best Buy responded to the controversy, claiming the price was computed incorrectly because the electronics company doesn't usually sell water in bulk.
A spokesperson told CNBC:
This was a big mistake on the part of a few employees at one store on Friday.
As a company we are focused on helping, not hurting affected people.
We're sorry and it won't happen again.
Not as an excuse but as an explanation, we don't typically sell cases of water.
The mistake was made when employees priced a case of water using the single-bottle price for each bottle in the case.
Sure, blame it on the water…
You'd think they'd know how to handle disaster sites after all those Black Fridays!

Houston locals are being told to get out or die as Hurricane Harvey reaches its eighth day of destruction.
The death toll has risen to 31, this Thursday morning, a number that officials claim is sure to rise if residents don’t begin evacuating the area immediately.
As Harvey continues to make its way towards Louisiana, water levels in the Neches River are expected to rise up to 82 feet.
All residents living in Mt.
Neches, Barlow Lake Estates, Works Bluff on CR 4415, Sheffield Ferry and Bottom Loop-CR 4700 who have not already evacuated must do so immediately, wrote Tyler County Judge Jacques Blanchette in a statement on Wednesday.
Anyone who chooses to not heed this directive cannot expect to be rescued and should write their social security numbers in permanent marker on their arm so their bodies can be identified.
The loss of life and property is certain.
GET OUT OR DIE! she continued.
Couples, mothers and innocent locals have been found dead in the muddy waters, as their cars were swept away by the violent currents.
Tornado Disasters And Destruction r
Governor Greg Abbott warned residents to stay away from flooded roads, especially while driving.
The worst is not over yet, he said.
In the past 48 hours, one victim drowned to death while tying to swim across a flooded road.
Two others were electrocuted by submerged power lines while attempting to recue stranded individuals.
Countless people, including journalists reporting on the event, have gone missing.
We were hanging on for dear life, recalled photojournalist Ruaridh Connellan after surviving the storm’s ferocious winds.
The water smelled putrid, like stagnant sewage, mixed with everything else.
Due to the high intensity of the winds and currents, a chemical plant near Houston exploded, with the company saying it was inevitable.
Before the incident, the company’s CEO, Richard Rowe, said in a statement: Materials could now explode and cause a subsequent intense fire.
The high water that exists on site, and the lack of power, leave us with no way to prevent it.
After more than a week of massive destruction, it seems there is no end in sight for Tropical Storm Harvey.
The death toll is still expected to rise dramatically.
I’m worried about how many bodies we’re going to find, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said after one of his officers drowned on Tuesday.
It’s imperative that we do everything possible to protect the lives and safety of people across the state of Texas as we continue to face the aftermath of this storm, concluded Governor Abbott.

After being bashed for allegedly closing his church doors to evacuees during Hurricane Harvey’s massive destruction of Houston, celebrity pastor Joel Osteen has finally come forward to explain his side of the story.
It’s totally not true, Osteen told GMA of the allegations made against him and his church.
We were here for people, we were a shelter, we were taking people as soon as the floodwaters receded.
As RadarOnline.
com previously reported, social media users criticized the minister after Lakewood published a statement via Facebook saying that the 6,000 square foot mega-church was inaccessible due to severe flooding.

People are now taking shelter in the space, and the church has started accepting donations.
After the backlash, hundreds of volunteers have come forward to help.
The city has a shelter four miles from here, said Osteen, we work with the city all the time and when their shelter was totally full they started bringing people over here and here we are again today doing it like we did in 2001 when we housed 3,000 people.
I think someone created that narrative that somehow we were high and dry and none of that is true, added Osteen.
It was a safety issue and we took people in from the very beginning.
He added then when the flooding occurred, the last thing they wanted to do was leave people inside the space.

Osteen also claimed his niece was actually stranded right across the street from the church during the fist two days of the hurricane, adding that it was a huge tragedy for everyone in Houston and they reached out to house the public as soon as they could.
We’ve been here 60 years helping people and we’re gonna be here long after this dies down helping people as well, he said.
Speaking of how the church will help moving forward after the natural disaster, the pastor said: We’ll get them out of the shelters over time when we can but they need help rebuilding their lives.
He claimed that many ministers and organizations have reached out to him wanting to help.
We’re in it for the long-hall, he said, that’s the key.

Steve Harveys eye-rolling rags-to-riches fairy tale of going from homeless bum to $100 million mastermind is a shameless scam built on lies!
Evidence uncovered in a RadarOnline.
com investigation exposes the haunting secrets and scandalous accusations behind the TV King of Sin’s megawatt smile and hollow success.
In a shocking dossier of sealed documents leaked to Radar, Harvey is accused of using sleazy intimidation tactics, crooked bagmen and hired thugs to do his dirty work — all in order to cheat his own family!
The deeper you dig and the further you look into Steve’s secret past, the more shocking it becomes, a source blasted.
Frankly, there doesn’t seem to be one single shred of decency to him as a man, father, husband or entertainer!
PHOTOS: Style SOS! Steve Harvey’s Team Begging Him To Get A Makeover
The phony funnyman selfishly walked out on pregnant wife Marcia and their twin daughters to follow his dream of becoming a comedian.
But while he is fond of repeating how tough times left him living in his car for three years, he rarely mentions his former family had to take him to court to get almost $40,000 in child support.
Steve is nothing but a fraud and a fake, an industry source ranted.
Determined to keep his fortune, Harvey allegedly amassed a crack team of fixers when his second marriage ­— to Mary Shackelford — went sour in 2005.
PHOTOS: Sailing Away From Trouble! Steve Harvey Hides On His Yacht As Scandals Explode
Newly unearthed legal documents accused the Family Feud favorite of hiding assets and his true worth during the exhausting divorce process.
Harvey is also accused of shamelessly trying to cover his tracks by sealing the documents and slapping a gag order on Shackelford.
It’s rare anyone gets a gagging order or documents sealed unless they have something to hide, one legal eagle snitched.
At the time, Steve Harvey wasn’t the household name he is today, so it does make you wonder what his motives were.
Those motives, as revealed exclusively by Radar, appeared to be exposed in notes contained in Shackelford and Harvey’s divorce decree.
PHOTOS: Out Of Here! Steve Harvey Flees Country Amid Marriage Problems
It is my belief that Mr.
Harvey knowingly and willfully lied to me as well as to the courts, the document noted.
A legal source close to the case warned that Harvey, 60, may have committed perjury.
Mr.
Harvey did not fully disclose assets, lied about the status of a yacht, $800,000 and did not include or list all his companies.
The documents then claimed how one of Harvey’s longtime representatives working on the legal separation is an entertainment lawyer — not a divorce attorney!
PHOTOS: Ami’s Family SLAMS Billy’s Lies — Child Bride Was Spoiled Rotten In Dream Upbringing
What’s more, the associate was also allegedly engaged in business deals and secret slush funds with Harvey, and originally represented Shackelford in the divorce, before swapping sides!
Every time Mary filed, Steve’s associate notified redacted.
He was alerting him to move money.
He broke client’s confidentiality agreement, it’s claimed in documents.
Shackelford previously launched a lawsuit against the attorney, claiming he was always secretly working in Steve’s interest while representing her.
The divorce decree divided the couple’s assets, and far from losing everything as Harvey has described, the Little Big Shots host walked away with 14 plots of land in Texas, various companies, bank accounts, equities, trusts and 29 vehicles including three Rolls-Royce cars, three Range Rovers, a speedboat and two Maybach 57s.

The divorce notes also said Harvey initially claimed financial hardship, yet misrepresented to the court as he bought five lavish new properties with new partner Marjorie Bridges.
In the decree, Shackelford is promised property, but the notes — made in early 2008 — claimed she hadn’t received the required quitclaim deed to take ownership of her own house.
Steve thinks he’s the boss in every walk of life, a source explained.
He appears to be a lovable funnyman on TV, but off-screen his persona is all business, and not friendly at all.
He knows what it’s like to have nothing, added the source.
He’s very protective of his fortune and thinks the best way to do that is to destroy anyone foolish enough to cross him!

Harvey Kills 31, Houston Residents Told To Get Out Or Die’
Pastor Joel Osteen Bashes Haters After Church Controversy: It’s Totally Not True, 
Inside Steve Harvey's $100 Million Empire Of Lies!
Rescue efforts in Houston are in full swing, and, no, people aren't forgetting the 4-legged victims.
This tortoise was rescued Wednesday on a tugboat by Aaron Jayjack during historic flooding in the city.
He looks a bit discombobulated, albeit safely aboard and secure.
As we reported, Harvey will have an enormous impact on pets as they become displaced and separated from their homes and owners.
This big guy might be a shell of his former self after the storm, but at least he isn't turnt up in the water.
Master P thinks Kevin Hart is missing the boat by strong-arming celebs into donating $25k for Harvey relief.
The hip-hop mogul has personally donated a significant amount but won't say how much, and he thinks that's the way it should be.
People shouldn't be judged by how much they give, they should give from the heart, and it's not a competition.
Master P knows a thing or 2 about hurricanes, he's from NOLA and helped with the Katrina disaster relief.
Leonardo DiCaprio is one bashful humanitarian after shelling out a million bucks for victims of Harvey, but that's still not throwing off his game with hot chicks.
We got Leo Wednesday night leaving TAO in Hollywood with a handful of ladies, and as they all board an SUV, the actor tries sneaking past the cameras outside all incognito, this after sending a whopping mil to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund.
No need to be shy, bud - you're a playboy with a big heart.
We're guessing that can only go over well with your usual crowd.
Rita Ora ﻿talked about pitching in on Hurricane Harvey relief, then walked the walk by chipping in at a donation center.
Rita was in Dallas and said early Wednesday she wanted to do something to help out before leaving Texas.
Hours later, the singer was dressed down - in t-shirt and sweats - and filling boxes with donated items for evacuees.
A long list of celebs have given big money - notably Leonardo DiCaprio donated $1 million, and Houston Texans star J.J. Watt's relief fund is well over $7 mil.
We don't know if Rita gave dough, but it's cool to see her giving the old-fashioned way - time and effort.
As much as people are suffering in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, pets are going through it just as bad, according to one expert.
Professional pet sitter and veterinary nurse Diana Carreon says animals process displacement and trauma the same as humans.
She explains how the emotional impact of Harvey can impact pets, from withdrawal to aggressiveness.
Diana also says animals can suffer PTSD in ways similar to humans, and their recovery process varies wildly.
She also says the only cure for certain, significant trauma may be meds.
Leo DiCaprio is the winner in charitable donations for Hurricane Harvey relief, he's just cut a check for $1 million.
Leo's foundation gave the money to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund, it will be used for both short and long-term relief.
United Way says the entire amount will go to help victims of the epic storm.
This is the first donation to the newly established United Way fund to help victims of the hurricane.
A number of celebs have donated, notably the Kardashian family gave $500k.
Sandra Bullock also gave $1 million to the cause
John O'Hurley isn't buying reports Hurricane Harvey is strong proof of dramatic climate change, at least not until he sees some hard numbers.
We got the Seinfeld star leaving Craig's and he says it's too soon for scientists to pin Harvey on global warming.
He explains what it would take to prove it, for him, at least.
O'Hurley's a longtime conservative, and a Trump guy, so his stance isn't all that surprising.
Of course, if he's looking for numbers, we'd suggest checking the data on Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, and the polar ice caps.
What's left of them, that is.
President Trump will not get an invite to appear in the Hurricane Harvey telethon, unless he's there with the former presidents - especially Barack Obama - in a gesture of unity, so says telethon organizer Bun B.
The legendary Houston rapper tells TMZ, Putting Trump on by himself would send the wrong message and people wouldn't buy the sincerity of it, adding, After what he did in Charlottesville, he's not a symbol of unity and it would rub people the wrong way.
Bun B says he'd like Trump on the September 12 telethon - which will be broadcast on CBS, NBC, ABC and FOX from 8-9 PM - but only in 2 configurations.
He thinks putting all the former POTUSes together - all of whom have had their issues - would show unity.
Even better, Bun B says, would be Trump and Obama alone, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
It would telegraph that 2 men embroiled in deep conflict could come together for a noble purpose.
But Bun made it clear, Trump's not delivering a message alone, saying, We don't need a teleprompter President.
Pastor Joel Osteen says his church was unfairly criticized for locking its doors to Hurricane Harvey evacuees.
The man who leads the Lakewood Church in Houston says the doors were always open, despite the video TMZ posted which was shot Monday, showing the church was accessible yet the doors were locked.
Osteen says it was a confusing time and says if people were turned away it may have been the fault of a security company.
At any rate, the doors are now open, Osteen says the church is in it for the long haul and hundreds of people are now calling his place of worship a temporary home.
Lisa Rogers is living in a leaky trailer on top of a hill so she can give comfort to one of her beloved rescue horses.
Lisa runs Amazing Grace Acres Equine Rescue & Rehab.
Among her brood, 12 horses, 2 donkeys, 1 mule, 1 pony, 1 potbellied pig, 22 cats and 3 dogs.
All of the animals are with her as she tries to figure out her next move.
A significant portion of the rescue effort is now being devoted to saving and caring for displaced animals.
The photo below is Billy Hutson from Austin who came to Houston to help rescue animals.
The J.J. Watt charity train keeps on rollin, as his Hurricane Harvey relief fund just broke $10 MILLION.
And a couple HUGE celebs helped him do it - Ellen DeGeneres and Miley Cyrus!! Ellen presented a check from Walmart for a cool $1 mil during a show taping on Wednesday - adding to her previous personal donation of $50K.
Miley threw down $500K of her own, and was pretty emotional as she discussed the tragedy in H-Town.J.J., who FaceTimed into the show, said I have no words, before promising their cash would go a long way toward helping victims. J.J. Watt's relief fund for Hurricane Harvey victims just cracked $7 MILLION - and he ain't stoppin there! Watt's crowdfunding campaign started with a target of $500K on Sunday, and quickly climbed into the millions with generous donations from star athletes like Chris Paul.
Now, the Houston Texans star is steppin it up even more - setting a new goal of $10 million,  the same amount donated by Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander.
FYI, Watt shared his plans for the cash when he hit $6 mil - saying his team is filling up semitrucks to distribute water, food and other supplies throughout Houston.
Ethika Underwear will have Houston's back and front covered - thanks to a massive shipment of sports bras and underwear that's headed to Texas.
Ethika announced Wednesday it had sent 14,000 pairs of men's, women's, and kids underwear to George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston to hook up more than 8,000 evacuees there in the wake of Harvey.
CEO Matt Cook says, I started thinking about the people in Houston and the fact they were displaced from their homes and missing basic necessities, including clean underwear, and it just made sense to help out.
The donated underwear amounts to more than $250K in retail value.
Not to worry guys, you don't have to be as gifted as The Game to rock these briefs.

Kendall Jenner Sparks Dating Rumors with Blake Griffin
Look away, A$AP Rocky!
It looks like Kendall Jenner is totally over A$AP Rocky these days!
Once again fueling romance rumors, the 21-year-old model was spotted on yet another fancy dinner date with rumored beau Blake Griffin.
This time, the pair were joined by Kendall’s BFF Hailey Baldwin and Blake’s fellow NBA star, Chandler Parsons.
Blake and Kendall left Craig’s in L.A. together and got into a waiting car.
Chandler followed shortly after.
Hailey was definitely with the group … but didn’t want to be part of the mass exodus.
Chandler and Hailey have been spotted together in the past but insist they’re not exclusively dating.
See a video of their double date night over at TMZ…
This Is How Kendall Jenner Really Feels About Her Pepsi Ad
It's been a bad week.
Kendall Jenner is the Fashion Icon of the Decade, and people are pissed.
The 21-year-old model is at the center of backlash once again after Fashion Media Awards announced she would be receiving the top honor at this year’s ceremony.
While the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has arguably become one of the runway’s most sought-after It-girls, many are outraged seeing how she’s not been around enough to be deemed an icon in the fashion world.
kendall jenner and more star sightings of the day
Confusion seems to be collective response on social media as critics argue that Kendall was just 11 a decade ago and has only been professionally modeling for six years.
Literally giving kendall jenner a fashion icon of the decade award is insulting
Kendall’s outfits are nice and I always look forward to seeing what she wears but like fashion icon of the decade?? Idk about that
I love Kendall but why would she get fashion icon of the decade award when she was a child for half of it
lol giving kendall jenner a fashion icon of the decade award when she’s been in the industry for less than 5 years is insulting ‍
This is the first time in the Fashion Media Awards’ five-year run that will feature a Fashion Icon of the Decade Award.
Photographer Mario Testino and Hearst’s chief content officer Joanna Coles will also be honored at the ceremony in New York City next week.
We’re living in a digital decade and Kendall is the ultimate style influencer.
The digital generation more than ever turns to social media to learn what’s next and Kendall has 83 million devoted Instagram followers, many of whom emulate her style.
Kendall has also captured the hearts of the leading fashion magazines, photographers, and brands, a spokesperson for the Daily Front Row says.
A fashion icon is someone who influences the look of a generation and Kendall has been making a huge impact on their style.
For the record: This was what Kendall looked like almost 10 years ago in 2008.

So, you know we have to ask…
Ahead of NYFW, it's said Kendall Jenner will be honored at the Daily Front Row's Fashion Media Awards in September with Fashion Icon of the Decade!!
That's a big deal considering just a decade ago, the starlet was only 11 years old!

While the supermodel tweeted out her gratitude about it when she got wind of it earlier this week, not everyone is as happy about Kenny's news!
thank you for the endless love 
People are PISSED!
They weren't hiding their emotions about it, taking to Twitter: 
Rihanna, Beyoncé, Zendaya, Tracee Ellis Ross, Grace Jones, or even Yara Shahidi and y'all give it to Kendall Jenner?

im sorry is Rihanna dead? did she die and no one told me? why is she receiving this?

It goes on, for real!
Do U think Kenny deserves Fashion Icon of the Decade?? Sound OFF in the comments!
This is one trend we do NOT want to keep up with!
As we reported, Kendall and Kylie Jenner were accused of appropriating Latinx culture by questionably styling a plaid shirt from their Kendall + Kylie line.

If they're NOT dating by now, they should be.
Blake Griffin and Kendall Jenner went out to a fancy romantic dinner AGAIN - this time, they were joined by fellow NBA star Chandler Parsons and Hailey Baldwin.
Blake and Kendall left Craig's in L.A. together and got into a waiting car.
Chandler followed shortly after.
Hailey was definitely with the group, but didn't want to be part of the mass exodus.
Chandler and Hailey have been spotted together in the past but insist they're not exclusively dating.
Blake and Kendall have been spending a lot of time together, too.
But no official confirmation there either.
Bottom line - four attractive, rich, famous people hanging out.
What do YOU think is happening? 
Kendall Jenner will not be one of the angels walking the catwalk for the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but it was her choice, made easier by a boatload of cash.
Our Kardashian family sources tell us Kendall didn't even audition for the gig because she has a major deal to be the face - and other body parts - of La Perla.
We're told her multi-million dollar deal with the upscale lingerie line includes a non-compete clause, so, walking for VS would've been a major no-no, anyway.
Fans were surprised when the list of models for this year's VS show didn't include Kendall - especially because she did it last year, and her pal, Gigi Hadid, is doing it.
What can we say? The chick got a wayyy better deal.
If you're disappointed, there's always 2016.

Kylie Jenner ﻿is a heaux who feeds off attention and gets injections in her lips and her fat ass, this according to Cash Me Outside girl Danielle Bregoli's new music video.
The 14-year-old rapper turned her diss guns on the reality star in her new music video for her single, These Heaux, and TMZ's obtained a short clip of the vid in which Danielle injects a faux Kylie.
No, really, she injects Kylie's lips and ass.
Danielle, blunt as hell since 2003.
TMZ broke the story, Danielle's These Heaux took aim at all kinds of bitches - broke, fake and jealous ones with lyrics like, These hoes be lackin', see me in back and, they talk all this sh*t but don't say it in person.

They found love in paradise!
Taylor Nolan and Derek Peth got engaged during the taping of Bachelor in Paradise’s aftershow on Wednesday, PEOPLE confirms.
The duo, who met on the fourth season of BiP, hit it off from the start.
Throughout their short time on the show, Nolan and Peth remained solid in their relationship — but not without some bumps along the way.
During Tuesday’s episode, the couple found themselves discussing the possibly of pursuing their relationship outside of Paradise.
When Nolan expressed her concerns, Peth responded with, F— you, which did not sit well with the mental health counselor.
However, love seemed to trump all, because the two moved past the drama and worked things out.
In June, production on season 4 was temporarily suspended after two producers voiced concern about Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson’s sexual encounter.
Warner Brothers later determined no misconduct had occurred.
RELATED VIDEO: Corinne Olympios Lawyers End Investigation into Bachelor in Paradise Misconduct Claims with No LawsuitDespite the backlash, both Nolan and Peth returned to Paradise after the shutdown … and ultimately found love!
The Bachelor in Paradise finale will air on Sept.
11 at  on ABC.
Bachelor in Paradise is almost here! With less than two weeks until the season 4 premiere, ABC has released the first official photo of the cast.
The group shot was seemingly taken before the much-talked about sex scandal surrounding Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, as both appear in the photograph.
Though neither Jackson nor Olympios returned as cast members when BiP resumed filming after an internal investigation concluded there was no evidence of misconduct between the two, they will be appearing on the reunion special, which will be televised later this summer.
PEOPLE previously revealed the exclusive first look at the official portrait for this season, which features two intertwined hearts drawn in the sand accompanied by rose pedals and the phrase The beach is open typed atop turquoise waters.
Several contestants confirmed they are returning to Mexico for the fourth season of the Bachelor/ette spinoff, including Amanda Stanton, Jasmine Goode, Raven Gates, Lacey Mark, Dean Unglert, Vinny Ventiera, Robby Hayes, Taylor Nolan, Kristina Schulman and more.
In June, BiP production was suspended after producers raised concerns about a sexual encounter between contestant Jackson, 30, and Olympios, 24, both of whom had reportedly been drinking heavily all day.
Filming on the fourth season of BiP had stopped due to what the production company called a misconduct.
RELATED VIDEO: Vinny Ventiera on Returning to Paradise Following Corinne Olympios & DeMario Jackson Scandal — We Turn It Into a Positive Thing’ Days after production was shut down by Warner Bros.
to investigate the misconduct and the contestants were sent home, Olympios and Jackson both released statements.
I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4.
Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production, Olympios said in a statement to PEOPLE via her rep.
Like Olympios, Jackson also retained legal counsel, and said in his statement, It’s unfortunate that my character and family name has been assassinated this past week with false claims and malicious allegations.
I will be taking swift and appropriate legal action until my name is cleared and, per the advice of legal counsel, will be seeking all available remedies entitled to me under the laws.
Warner Bros.
said in a statement that the company does not intend to release the videotape of the incident, but insisted that they plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.
FROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time Two weeks after production was shut down, and after Warner Bros.
announced that its investigation was complete and concluded that there was no evidence of misconduct, Olympios announced that she would not be taking legal action in the wake of the scandal.
Season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise will kick off its two-night premiere on Monday, Aug.
14 at 8 p.m., and continue on Tuesday, Aug.
15 at 8 p.m., both on ABC.

Telling her side.
As you surely know, season four of Bachelor In Paradise almost didn't happen after allegations of sexual misconduct hit the set.
At the time, it was believed that Corinne Olympios was too drunk to consent to a sexual encounter with BiP costar DeMario Jackson.
Related: Corinne Is More Successful Than Ever!
However, after Warner Bros.
concluded an investigation into the matter, production resumed as everyone involved were cleared of any wrongdoing.
Of course, this didn't stop the media from speculating about what exactly went down in Paradise — painting both Olympios and Jackson in poor lights.
That's why we were so interested in hearing Miz Olympios side of the story during her sit down on BiP with Chris Harrison.
Understandably, Nick Viall's ex was really nervous about the tell-all as it was her first time talking about what happened.
In regards to how she's doing post-scandal, the Bachelor season 21 villain was doing a lot better as she had her mom to lean on during this time.
Well that's good to hear.
After Harrison brought up the details which led to BiP's temporary halt in production, Corinne added:
The first day, unfortunately, I don't remember much of.
I definitely overdrank.
I was also on some medication that you're not supposed to drink on… I am now weaning myself off that medication.
Now, before you jump to conclusions, Corinne explained that she hadn't been on the medication until AFTER her stint on the Bachelor and had never experienced a blackout on the prescription before the BiP incident.
On why she may've seemed fine while filming, the Miami native shared:
It can look like you're totally present and totally there, and your mind is just not anywhere near.
How scary.
As for the morning after the encounter, Corinne said she laid in bed and thought:
I just don't understand.
Oh, and the blonde businesswoman was quick to add that she has no hard feelings towards DeMario and stated that they went about their day normally the day after the incident.
In fact, Corinne didn't even flinch when Harrison asked if she thought Jackson did anything wrong.
She continued:
I honestly don't think he did anything wrong.
I don't think it's anyone's fault.
It's just a really unfortunate, annoying situation that had to go down.
You can say that again.
The reality TV vet then went on to blame the medication/alcohol combo once again for the disaster on set.
Also, Corinne made sure to wish DeMario well as she reiterated to the crowd:
I don't blame DeMario.
I don't even know what to call it.
It's just so heart-sinking.
We're sure Rachel Lindsay's ex appreciates the support — albeit delayed.
Now, for what you've all been waiting for, the OTHER memorable moments from last night's showing of Paradise.
Daniel Maguire arrived in Paradise following Matt Munson's exit and Lacey Mark was THRILLED about it.
However, the professional Canadian wasn't as excited as he called Marks the scraps of Paradise.
He then proceeded to flirt with Jasmine Goode and Christen Whitney.
The rose ceremony took an inneresting turn when Matt returned to give Jasmine a rose… but still left the show.
We guess he was trying to do the honorable thing?? In response to his kind gesture, Goode called Munson a little bitch to the cameras.
Awkward.
Here's how the rest of the rose ceremony went down: Jack Stone gave his rose to Christen.
Derek Peth gave his rose to Taylor Nolan.
Robby Hayes gave his rose to Amanda Stanton.
Diggy Moreland gave his rose to Dominique Alexis.
Adam Gottschalk gave his rose to Raven Gates.
Ben Zorn gave his rose to Danielle Lombard.
Dean Unglert gave his rose to Kristina Schulman.
Thus, Alexis Waters and Sarah Vendal were sent packing.
Dean later had a change of heart, which furthered his love triangle plot line, as he went on to make out with Danielle L.
in the pool.
Kristina responded by sobbing about the drama to Robby.
Rachel Lindsay's Tickle Monster arrived and whisked Christen off on a date.
The twosome seemed to really hit it off, but upon their return, Whitney turned around and made out with Jack S.
Dramaaaaa!
Bachelor In Paradise airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
Cobb County, Georgia, police lieutenant Greg Abbott is under investigation after talking about killing black people.
Um, whut??
In a DUI arrest captured on dash cam, a white female passenger says she's afraid to reach for her cell phone because she's seen way too many videos of cops…
Related: Aaron Rodgers Defends Colin Kaepernick's Police Brutality Protesting
Abbott gets what she means right away and interrupts her, saying:
But you're not black.
Remember, we only kill black people.
What in the hell was he thinking?? He continues: 
Yeah.
We only kill black people, right? All the videos you've seen, have you seen the black people get killed?
Ugh.
The incident is from way back in July 2016 but has only recently been released to the public.
Abbott, who has been a police officer for 28 years and should know better, is now on administrative duty pending an investigation.
Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register released a statement saying:
No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county.
Lt.
Abbott has not spoken out about the incident, but his attorney, Lance LoRusso, released a statement on his behalf saying the comment was an unorthodox way to de-escalate a situation involving an uncooperative passenger.

Even if it did work to de-escalate that situation, it is the kind of comment that escalates tension between the black community and police nationwide.

Taylor Swift fans got duped hard into thinking she was following up her record-breaking single and music vid debut with a live performance, but someone pulled a fast one, TMZ has learned.
Fans thought Taylor was appearing on GMA Thursday morning due to a DIRECTV search of her name which brought up 2 movies and GMA.
Yes, Taylor was in the Hannah Montana movie and The Lorax - but NO, she will absolutely not be on ABC Friday morning.
Our sources at the network say Taylor's not scheduled to perform or sit down for an interview.
It's unclear why GMA was included in the search results, but feel free to adjust your DVRs.
We're guessing she'll pop up somewhere soon though when and if Look What You Made Me Do hits #1, as it's expected to do.
