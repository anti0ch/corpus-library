It looks like Kendall Jenner is totally over A$AP Rocky these days!

Once again fueling romance rumors, the 21-year-old model was spotted on yet another fancy dinner date with rumored beau Blake Griffin. This time, the pair were joined by Kendall‚Äôs BFF Hailey Baldwin and Blake‚Äôs fellow NBA star, Chandler Parsons.
Via TMZ:
Blake and Kendall left Craig‚Äôs in L.A. together and got into a waiting car. Chandler followed shortly after. Hailey was definitely with the group ‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt want to be part of the mass exodus.
Chandler and Hailey have been spotted together in the past (sunbathing together in June) but insist they‚Äôre not exclusively dating.
See a video of their double date night over at TMZ‚Ä¶

Kendall Jenner is the Fashion Icon of the Decade, and people are pissed.

The 21-year-old model is at the center of backlash once again after Fashion Media Awards announced she would be receiving the top honor at this year‚Äôs ceremony. While the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has arguably become one of the runway‚Äôs most sought-after It-girls, many are outraged seeing how she‚Äôs not been around enough to be deemed an ‚Äúicon‚Äù in the fashion world.

Confusion seems to be collective response on social media as critics argue that Kendall was just 11 a decade ago and has only been professionally modeling for six years.

Literally giving kendall jenner a fashion icon of the decade award is insulting

This is the first time in the¬†Fashion Media Awards‚Äô¬†five-year run that will feature a Fashion Icon of the Decade Award. Photographer Mario Testino and Hearst‚Äôs chief content officer¬†Joanna Coles will also be honored at the ceremony in New York City next week.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a digital decade and Kendall is the ultimate style influencer. [The] digital generation more than ever turns to social media to learn what‚Äôs next and Kendall has 83 million devoted Instagram followers, many of whom emulate her style. Kendall has also captured the hearts of the leading fashion magazines, photographers, and brands,‚Äù a spokesperson for the¬†Daily Front Row says. ‚ÄúA fashion icon is someone who influences the look of a generation and Kendall has been making a huge impact on their style.‚Äù
For the record: This was what Kendall (and Kylie Jenner) looked like almost 10 years ago in 2008.

Ahead of NYFW, it's said Kendall Jenner will be honored at the Daily Front Row's Fashion Media Awards in September with Fashion Icon of the Decade!!
That's a big deal considering just a decade ago, the starlet was only 11 years old!

This is one trend we do NOT want to keep up with!
As we reported, Kendall and Kylie Jenner were accused of appropriating Latinx culture by questionably styling a plaid shirt from their Kendall + Kylie line.

Sadly, they aren't the only celebs who have been SLAMMED for borrowing from other cultures.
From Demi Lovato to Beyonc√©, A-list stars need to be more careful!

Miley Cyrus is the most empathetic pop star we know!
The Younger Now songstress broke down on Wednesday's Ellen while discussing the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, revealing she would be helping out the residents of Houston affected by the severe flooding.

After Ellen announced that Miley's Happy Hippie Foundation donated $500,000 to relief efforts, the 24-year-old shed tears thinking about all the victims who are experiencing heartbreak and loss.
Say what you want about her, but this girl truly has a heart of gold!
