I made my slow way home
Limpin' on broken bones
Out of the thickest part
Across the county lines
Onto your wooden stairs
I know you can't repair
I know you've seen the light
I know you'll get me right
Right, right, right
I own a sinner's heart
I know the rain falls hard
I know the currency
I know the things you'll need
I hope He hears my prayers
I see you cut your hair
I know the saving type
I know you'll get me right
Right, right, right
Oh Jesus, I've fallen
I don't mind the rain if
I meet my maker
I meet my maker
Clearly, Jesus
The truth is
I struggle so hard to believe
I need my maker, I need my maker
To cure me of my darling gun
And drain me of the sins I love
And take from me my disbelief
I know it should come easily
But it remains inside of me
It battles and devours me
It cuddles up the side of me
In whispers, it convinces me I'm
Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, rightIt was the year I crashed my motorbike
I think it was the summer
I think you whispered
"When you gonna wake up? When you gonna wake up?"
Dear, slip these on your tongue
Little seeds of reinvention
In angels hands the medicine
Of modern man
Wait now
Tell me that this isn't over
Hang on, just long enough
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
Even if it's just 'till morning
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
Stay here and we can start again
We could be made over
You'll hear us shouting
"When you gonna wake up? When you gonna wake up?"
Scared, well, everyone gets scared
Just signal when you're ready
In angel's hands
Sleep to steady, sleep so steady
Wait now
Tell me that this isn't over
Hang on, just long enough
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
Even if it's just 'till morning
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
If you're running from your secrets
I won't make you take them with you
I'm ready I can take it
You don't have to carry them alone
There's a way out if you want it
To an end or a new beginning
You just have to find it on your own
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
One more night
(If this is over)
One more night
(Or if it's just a warning)
Even if it's just 'till morning
One more night
(If this is over then)
One more night
(Why is it so hard?)
One more night
(Say you will stay with me)
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morningWe went rolling up the coast
Then there was no more coast to wander
We tried every different road
Just to see which took us further
We were living on the run
Though there was no one chasing after
We were looking out for love
And we were flirting with disaster
While the world fades out
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We stayed on the run too long
Hoping we'd never return
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down into cinders
We turned out into the plains
And turned in when we got tired
We slept two across the bench
And we fit three under the covers
We had just enough cash left
To top the tank and fill the cooler
And we lit the van with dreams
After the sun burned into cinders
And the world fades out
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We stayed on the run too long
Hoping we'd never return
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders, into cinders
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders, into cinders
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cindersDown in a local bar out on the Boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back like you never broke, you tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks he's getting close
For now you let him
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
In all your silver rings, in all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back here you never lost, you shake the shivers off
You take a drink to get your courage up
Can you believe it?
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, oh keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on
Down in a local bar out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't turn turn away
Let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the BoulevardWell, I know the trouble when the trouble starts
And I know the signals of a straying heart
And I know the stirrings of a double cross
And I see suspicions arise around you
I know the chatter as it starts to creep
I know the walls as they ring and repeat
I know the secrets they were meant to keep
And I see suspicions arise
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
I know about you
I know the ceiling when it starts to burn
And I know the season when it starts to turn
And I know the patterns that the wicked learn
And I see suspicions arise around you
I know the curtain and the way it falls
I know the burden and the pain it draws
I know you're sorry for something
But I don't know why
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about you
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about youI know that yesterday is gone
And it won't come back to me
But I miss it after all
It never really lasts as long
As it meant for it to be
Well the twists and turns
They're pulling us and tearing to the seams
But I'll meet you where we started once again
'Cause I miss you
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
We're only waiting on the sun
To clear away the haze
'Cause we can't see where we've gone
From where we started, where we strayed
And where we're meant to be
There'll be ash and dust to bury us
But I will keep you clean
And I'll meet you where we started once again
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the best is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take awayI lay down, I can't sleep
My mind runs on repeat
I stare at the ceiling from my side
I reach out, you're right there
But you're lost in the details
I wait for the end of the long night
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need you more than you know now
We play like we don't know
We both lie, but we don't show
It's something that's changing between us
You start out in one lane
The same road, the same name
But something we can't see divides us
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need you more than you know now
'Cause I need you more than you know now
'Cause I need you more than you know now
(Don't run away, don't run away)
'Cause I need you more than you know now
(Don't run away, don't run away)
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need this more than ever
'Cause I need you more than you know nowEven now, I can smell your clothes
Freshly from the wash
Still hot from the dryer
Even now, I can smell your skin
As I wrap you in a towel
Lay you on the bed
And try to love you
Even now, I can feel your arms
I can feel your breast
I can hear your songs
And I always can find you again
Even now, I can feel your hand
Gently over mine
With almost no weight at all
Even now, I can feel your eyes
Watch me as I strum
Much too late at night
Even now, I can see you smile
I can hear you hum
I can hear you sing
And I always can find you again
Even in the dark of night
Even in the lowest light
Even as the world outside
Is spinning and spinning
Even now, I can feel your hair
Blow across my cheek
As we sit in one of two chairs
Even now, I can feel your face
Resting on my chest
Wrestling for sleep
And failing at it
Even now, I can see you sleep
I can see you dream
I can see you fly
And I always can find you again
And I always can find you againFrom small pains to fiery burns
These are the signals of my dying nerves
Singed by the heat of your lines and curves
Into a fire that could scorch the earth
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through them, but I can't remember how to feel
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
From small shocks to surging bolts
These are the signals from my spinal cords
Sent down the wires through the lines and folds
Into a wire on my frontal lobe
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through them, but I can't remember how to feel
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
(I can't remember how to feel)
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of scienceI sit and wonder of your pause
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine?
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
And all is quiet and all your looks
Give no betrayal to what you shield or hide
Wider walls
Have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will protect your burning heart
I know your careful
'Cause I've been burned before and I know how it makes you careful
And I know your symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone, are you lonely?
Well, you just don't have to be
Lonely anymore
I don't like the looks of this
Without you there's no truth
But all my doubt and all my trust
Is no betrayal to what I feel inside
Wider walls
Have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will defend your beating heart
And I know your careful
'Cause I've been burned before and I know how that makes you careful
And I know yours symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone, are you lonely?
Well, you just don't have to be
Lonely anymore
I sit and wonder of your thoughts
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine?
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad newsThere's things I know
I should've mentioned sooner
But I didn't know how I'm sorry I lost you
I never thought that this could come between us
I know it's water and bridges now
But what's the sense of carrying around this weight?
These words are tearing me apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
That face, I know exactly what you're thinking
But I'm certain this time is different
And that's why I can't pretend that everything is mended
I know, I've tried to, for too long now
But what's the sense in carrying around this weight?
These words are tearing us apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
Oh, save me from a gray life
Oh, save me from the gray life
I've paid the price with my soul
Oh, save me
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chance, if I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chanceA line of strands to mark the trail
No one said it would be easy
I must admit I thought the risk
Was better waged in younger seasons
And all these years in the cold play hell on the throat
'Till everything I say burns like cinders
Well, it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the crease of a strangling winter
It's strange to be lost, stranger to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
Along the way the turns are sharp
No one said it would be easy
I must admit, I thought the trip
Was better made in younger seasons
But all these years in pursuit made a man of a fool
'Till every word I say is unwavered
Well, it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the case of a selfish believer
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
Well it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the case of a selfish believer
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
And when the path I have made from the grass to the grave
I will love you still
And when the sand turns to glass and all that's left is the past
I will love you stillThe sky glows
I see it shining when my eyes close
I hear your warnings but we both know
I'm gonna look at it again
Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
Well you get one look
I'll show you something that the knife took
A bit too early for my own good
Now let's not speak of it again
Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
Don't wait, don't wait
The lights will flash and fade away
The days will pass you by
Don't wait
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor downOh, sweet lungs don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
It drills me in my every step, I'm moving quick
But you're always on my heels
Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy but it needs you
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross the line
Will you carry me there one more time?
Steady lungs don't fail me know
I feel you bursting, but you won't let me die
Fill me up with every step, I'm feeling sick
But I'm leaving it behind
Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, you are not weak
My legs are sturdy but they need you to survive
My heart is sturdy but I need you
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross the line
Will you carry me there once more?
I have reason to believe that I have victories to taste
I can feel them on my teeth, upon my lips and in my chest
I can roll them on my tongue, they are more supple than defeat
I feel the tension in my lungs and every move is filled by my resolve to
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?The signal is subtle we pass just close enough to touch
No questions, no answers we know by now to say enough
With only simple words, with only subtle turns
The things we feel alone for one another
There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
So I won't sleep if you won't sleep tonight
Our act of defiance, we keep this secret in our blood
No paper or letters, we pass just close enough to touch
We love in secret names, we hide within our veins
The things that keep us bound to one another
There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
Until the last resilient hope is frozen deep inside my bones
And this broken fate has claimed me
And my memories for it's own
Your name is pounding through my veins
Can't you hear how it is sung?
And I can taste you in my mouth
Before the words escape my lungs and I'll whisper only once
There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we have to
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
'Cause you will be somebody's girl and you will keep each other warm
But tonight I am feeling coldWe watch the season pull up its own stage
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
Invitation only grant farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
Too early to say goodnight
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we all, we sleep well
Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep well
You have stolen, you have stolen
You have stolen my heart
I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
And we all look like we feel
You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heartThe first time you looked
At her curves you were hooked
And the glances you took, took hold of you
And demanded that you stay
And sunk in their teeth
Bit you hard and released
Such a charge that you need
Another touch, another taste, another fix
She just might get you lost
And she just might leave you torn
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you and she gets you any closer
And she leads you up
Points out skylines and stars
Steeplechases and bars and took your keys
And demanded that you stay
The city longs well for rooftops and invitations
All lace and secret places
She moves you to touch with her hands
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you and she gets you any closer
Under the cool sheet where the welcome touch
Of skin and skin will meet
Hot on the inside, where the girl's prize
Is at the tip of your tongue
Where every move and each impulse
Brings clarity
To stay like this is everything
You'll ever need
She just might get you lost
And she just might leave you torn
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
(If she gets you any closer)
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
Can you believe your eyes?Hand out of the window
Floatin’ on air
Just a flip of the wrist
And I'm wavin’ you goodbye
Drive past the lifeguard stand
Where I'd sit around
Waiting for you to remember
As I drive
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
And stay with you in your steps
And pace with you a while
For so long, so long, so long, so long
The speaker in this door is blown
So nothing sounds quite right
Taking my time, taking this drive
Waving this town, goodbye
And I drive this ocean road and remember
The small of your back, nape of your neck
I remember everything as I drive
Waving this town, goodbye
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay you in your steps
And pace with you a while
So long, so long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, so long
Taking my time, taking this drive
(So long, so long)
Waving this town, goodbye
(So long, so long)
So long, so long, so long, so long
And I will leave under the cover
Of summer’s kiss upon the sky
Like the stone face of your lover
Just before she says goodbye
And I was certain that the season
Could be held between my arms
But just as summer’s hold is fleeting
I was here but now I’m gone
(So long, so long)
And I’m gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)The air is visible around you, rising up
And off your lips in slow currents, and I watch
As your face is framed in its slow currents, drifting curls
A trailin' path, a long draft becomes a tress of blue ash
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it’s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down
The air is visceral around us
Turning in its simple steps on slow currents
And I watch as it pirouettes and spins in slow motion
A long drag becomes a slow dance in a halo of ember
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it’s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down
All the way down
And if this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, we burned our hands
If this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it's got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn
(Let it burn)
If it’s got to end
(Let it burn)
If it’s got to end
(Let it burn)
It ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our handsStand down, son
And start resting easy
You’ve done your service
I am proud to have you home and see you safe
It’s so good
You looked so strong
In that picture on the mantle
You sent your mom when you were gone
But you looked scared now
Hollow eyed, when are you coming?
When are you coming?
Back where you belong
I swear that it’s safe here
There’s nothing to fear at all
Come on back
Where you belong
The pressure releases
If you just let down your guard
Everything rests on you
You know that feelin' well
The ball is fallin', fallin', fallin'
So far from a close call
Your injuries aren’t mortal wounds
The only thing that’s killin' you
Is what you saw
And what you couldn’t stop
Well, you’re not the one I blame
It wasn’t your mistake
But you're safe now so come home
Back where you belong
I swear that it’s safe here
There’s nothing to fear at all
Come on back
Where you belong
The pressure releases
If you just let down your guard
It’s simple things, dad
I’m not hurt, I’m not dead
I just should be
Where my friends are lying
And I didn’t hate
Those that I killed
But they’re all dead now
And I’m here alive with satellites
And Friday nights and no one to judge me
Or the things that I’ve done at all
So how can I live with that?
Back where I belong
Back where I belong
Back where I belong
Back where I belong
Take me back where I belong
You swear that it’s safe here
There is nothing to fear at all
Take me back where I belong
The pressure releases
If I just let down my guardShe smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
Out in the breezeway
Down by the shore in the lazy summer
And she pulled you in
And she bit your lip and she made you hers
She looked deep into you as you lay together
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth
And she made you better than you'd been before
She told you bad things
You wished you could change in the lazy summer
And she told you, laughing down to her core
So she would not cry as she lay in your lap
She said, "Nobody here can live forever
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
She said, "No one is alone the way you are alone"
And you held her looser than you would have
If you ever could have known
Some things tie your life together, slender threads
And things to treasure days like that should last and last and last
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough of her
To hang on, hang on, hang on, hang onWe are the only ones who feel it
Tonight we drink, tonight we dance
We are the last ones who can hear it
We’re calling in whispers, we’re tired of waiting
We’ll take what we want
And we’ll leave what we know behind
We are still dreamers in our dead sleep
Naked and tangled, twisted in love
And tonight we are the only ones who feel it
So let it last all night
So let it last all night
Let the fire surround us, let it all cave in
Let it all burn wild, we are leaving it all behind
We are leaving it all behind
Heaven is here, heaven is here
Heaven is here
We're tangled and brave
We're naked and saved
Well, Heaven’s not waitin'
It’s spillin' its secrets, it's right here between us
And we’ve no other choice but belief
We’ve no other choice but belief
We’ve no other choice but belief
So let it last all night
So let it last all night
So let it last all night
So let it last all night
Naked and tangled, and twisted in love
And tonight we are the only ones who feel it
Heaven is here, Heaven is here
And tonight we are the only ones who feel itHope dangles on a string
Like slow-spinning redemption
Winding in, and winding out
The shine of it has caught my eye
And roped me in so mesmerizing
So hypnotizing
I am captivated
I am
Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong
I am right, I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself
So clear, like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intention
Oversized, and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye
And rendered me so isolated
So motivated
I am certain now that
I am
So turn up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my fingertips
Trace the moment, fall forever
Defense is paper-thin
Just one touch, and I'd been in
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip against the current
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
Like hope dangles on a string
Like slow-spinning redemptionBreathe in for luck
Breathe in so deep
This air is blessed
You share with me
This night is wild
So calm and dull
These hearts they race
From self control
Your legs are smooth
As they graze mine
We're doing fine
We're doing nothing at all
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
The words are hushed
Lets not get busted
Just lay entwined here
Undiscovered
Safe in here
From all the stupid questions
"Hey, did you get some?"
Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
Hands down
This is the best day
I can ever remember
I'll always remember
The sound of the stereo
The dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair
That you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock
When we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared
Together
The streets were wet
And the gate was locked
So I jumped it
And I let you in
And you stood at your door
With your hands on my waist
And you kissed me
Like you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
That you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant itYou called to say you wanted out
Well, I can't say I blame you now
Sometimes you've got to fold before you're found out
Well, thanks for waiting this long to show yourself, yourself
Cause now that I can see you
I don't think you're worth a second glance
So much for all the promises you made, they served you well
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me
So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well
Now it's gone and you're wasted on me
You called to say you wanted out
Well, I can't say I blame you now
Sometimes you've got to fold before you're found out
Well, thanks, thanks for waiting this long to show yourself, show yourself
Cause now that I can see you
I don't think you're worth a second glance
So much for all the promises you made, they served you well
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me
So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well
Now it's gone and you're wasted on me
I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get
So much for so much more
I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get
So much for so much more
Do what you must if that's what you wish
I can't be a party to this
You have a sense that you were born with
You'll find a way to make things right
I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get
So much for so much more
I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get
So much for so much more
I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get
So much for so much moreShe said, "I've got to be honest
You're wasting your time if you're fishing around here."
And I said, "You must be mistaken
I'm not foolin', this feelin' is real."
She said, "You've gotta be crazy!
What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark?"
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But I swear that you've got me all wrong, all wrong, all wrong
That you've got me..."
I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you if just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And I said, "I've got to be honest, I've been waiting for you all my life."
For so long I thought I was asylum bound
But just seeing you makes me think twice
And being with you here makes me sane
I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But are you brave enough to leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight?
You've got me..."
I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you if just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And this is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And this is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?Carry this picture for luck
Kept in a locket, tucked in your collar, close to your chest
Make it a secret, shown to the closest friends
And meet me at quarter to seven
The sun will still shine then, at this time of year
We'll head to the inlet
And we'll share a bottle there
And color the coast with your smile
It's the most genuine thing I've ever seen
I was so lost, but now I believe
And follow me south of the big docks, where they tether the boats
The rich men revere as so important, they hire our fathers to steer
And down to the edge of the water, where we'll spill our guts, and we'll name our fears
I'll give you this picture
Keep it and don't be scared
And color the coast with your smile
It's the most genuine thing I've ever seen
I was so lost, but now I believe in the coast
Your smile is the most genuine thing I've ever seen
I was so lost, but now I believe
Now I believe
Now I believe
Now I believeI catalog these steps now, decisive and intentioned
Precise and patterned specifically to yours
I'm talented at breathing, especially exhaling
So that my chest will rise and fall with yours
I'm careful not to wake you, fearing conversation
It's better just to hold you and keep you pacified
I'm talented with reason, I cover all the angles
I can fail before I ever try
Try to understand, there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
So won't you hold me now?
I will not bend, I will not break
Won't you hold me now?
I will not bend, I will not break
I am fairly agile. I can bend and not break
Or I can break and take it with a smile
And I am so resilient. I recover quickly
I'll convince you soon that I'm fine
Try to understand, there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
So won't you hold me now?
I will not bend, I will not break
Won't you hold me now?
For you I rise, for you I fall
Just hold me close to you
Just hold me close to you
Just hold me close to you
Just hold me close to you, to you
Try to understand, there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
So won't you hold me now?
Won't you hold me now, now, now, now, now, now?I guess it's luck, but it's the same hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much I could die from the words that you say
But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghosts
I guess it's luck, but it's the same hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play

Just bend the pieces 'til they fit, like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this
No, they weren't meant for this
Just bend the pieces 'til they fit, like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this
Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away, away, away, away from you again
Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghostsSharp disaster in a fresh new coma

A line above the step beneath the worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for is hardly the best
Tepid water, chase the pills with turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up all of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies
And don't blink. Everyone's watching
They'll think you're up to something
They need for you to be everything that they cannot
Morning calls for pain relief
A line above the step beneath the worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for is hardly the best
Tepid water, chase the pills with turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up all of the time, all of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies
And don't blink. Everyone's watching
They'll think you're up to something
They need for you to be everything that they cannot
And don't blink. Everyone's watching
They'll think you're up to something
They need for you to be everything that they cannot be themselves, be themselvesCarve your heart out yourself
Hopelessness is your cell
Since you've drawn out these lines
Are you protected from trying times?
Man, it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has
But lord, it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all
Oh, look now, there you go with hope again
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end
Dig your ditch deep enough to keep you clear of the sun
You've been burned more than once
You don't think much of trust
Man, it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has
But lord, it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all
Oh, look now, there you go with hope again
But I'll be sure your secret's safe with me
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end
You're treating me like I'm already gone
But I'm not; I will stay where you are, always
I will stay, I will stay, I will stay
I will stay, I will stay, I will stay
I will stay, I will stay, I will stayI heard that you were home again
But you don't look like you're back to me
With your focuses changing, your gaze is transfixed on a point that I can't often see
You've got your new ties. I've got my old knots
You've got your inside line
But you're never happy with what you've got
Careful now, you're so beautiful when you've convinced yourself that no one else is quite as beautiful
I heard that you were living well
But you don't look like you're living to me
Though the sparkle is gone, your smile is in place, so that everyone watching will see
You've got them all convinced
But I know so well that you could list your friends, but you can't count on them
Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced that you're alright when no one else is quite as vulnerable
As soon as you've got it you want something else
It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell
It's not the price that's gonna cost you
It's just the weight that's gonna bring you down, down, down, down
It's gonna bring you down, down, down, down, down
It's gonna bring you down, down, down, down
It's gonna bring you down, down, down, down, down
Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced that you're alright when no one else is quite as vulnerable
Careful now, you're so beautiful when you've convinced yourself that no one else is quite as beautiful
You're so beautiful
As soon as you've got it you want something else
It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell
It's not the price that's gonna cost you
It's just the weight that's gonna bring you down, down, down, down
It's gonna bring you down, down, down, down, down
As soon as you've got it you want something else
It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell
It's not the price that's gonna cost you
It's just the weight that's gonna bring you downHey girl, you've got a smart way
About you that makes me wish that I was smart enough for you
Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
And I think that I can get used to that
And you're already used to laughing at me
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live
Like it's the latest attraction
Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
And I've got designs on lighting you up
And setting you off
And watching you burn for me
The world lives for the weekends
Well I watched as my weeks bleed right into them
Without a line to divide what is theirs
And what is mine
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live like it's the latest attraction
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need loveWhat you found sure upset you
Never saw it coming did you?
It's easy to be surprised with both your eyes sewn closed
Handled with great precision, another faultless execution
You're the subject of this exhibition
A willing cadaver, a willing cadaver
Scalpeled, sutured, made whole again
These cuts are leaving creases
Trace the scars to fit the pieces, to tell your story, you don't need to say a word
Call off the cavalry, [you] can't save a wretch like me
Clean this with kerosene
If you can't leave it be, might as well make it bleed
Scalpeled, sutured, made whole again
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to stand and fight
There's something better wrong with you
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to fight a riot
There's something better wrong with you
Your pulse is anemic, you're tired of the fire
You're bruising too easy, and falling behind
And no one is waiting for you, and no one is waiting for you
And no one is waiting for you, and no one is waiting, and no one is waiting for you, for you, for you
Call off the quarantine, [you] can't save the rest from me
Clean this with kerosene
If you can't leave it be, might as well make it bleed
Scalpeled, sutured, made whole again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to stand and fight
There's something better wrong with you
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to stand and fight
There's something better wrong with youPacific sun, you should have warned us it gets so cold here
And the night can freeze before you set it [on] fire
And our flares go unnoticed, diminished
Faded just as soon as they are fired
We are, we are intrigued
We are, we are invisible
Oh, how we've shouted, how we've screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
But all our fears fall on deaf ears
Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies
While closing our caskets cold and tight
But I'm dying to live
Pacific sun, you should have warned us
These heights are dizzying, and the climb can kill you long before the fall
And our trails go unmarked and unmapped and covered just as soon as they are crossed
We are, we are intriguing
We are, we are desirable
Oh, how we've shouted, how we've screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
But all our fears fall on deaf ears
Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies
While closing our caskets cold and tight
But I'm dying to live
Oh, how we've shouted, how we've screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
But all our fears fall on deaf ears
Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies
While closing our caskets cold and tight
But I'm dying to liveSo this is odd
Painful realization
That all has gone wrong
And nobody cares at all
And nobody cares at all
So you buried all your lover's clothes
And burned the letters lover wrote
But it doesn't make it any better
Does it make it any better?
And the plaster dented from your fist
In the hall where you had your first kiss
Reminds you that the memories will fade
So this is strange
Our sidestepping has come to be
A brilliant dance
Where nobody leads at all
Where nobody leads at all
And the picture frames are facing down
And the ringing from this empty sound
Is deafening and keeping you from sleep
And breathing is a foreign task
And thinking's just too much to ask
And you're measuring your minutes
By a clock that's blinking eights
Well, this is incredible
Starving, insatiable
Yes, this is love for the first time
And you'd like to think that you were invincible
Yeah, well weren't we all once
Before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last timeI'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets
But you’re not alone and you’re not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home
I'm reading your note over again
There’s not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it "I will love you always & forever."
As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder how you're making out
And as for me I wish that I was anywhere with anyone making out
I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you’re pretending
I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets
And I am alone in my defeat
I wish I knew you are safely at home
I'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wearI heard about your trip
I heard about your souvenirs
I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights
And the cool guys that you spent them with
I guess I should have heard of them from you
Don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over?
And all the "Best Deceptions" and the  "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service
To keeping you away
I heard about your regrets
I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
I'll be all right when my hands get warm
Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing
I'd rather you'd never heard my voice
You’re calling too late, too late to be gracious and you do not warrant long good-byesThis ruined puzzle is beige with the pieces all face down
So the placing goes slowly
The pictures of anything other than it's meant to be
But the hours, they creep, the patterns repeat
Don't be concerned, you know I'll be fine on my own
I never said "don't go", “don’t go”
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back
It says "Does he ever get the girl?"
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?
Well, this basement's a coffin, I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe
Cause you're gone, I get nothing
And you're off with barely a sigh
I never said "Good-bye"
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you read if you’re so inclined
"Does he ever get the girl?"
Does he ever get the girl?This is where I say I've had enough
And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now
A walking open wound
A trophy display of bruises
And I don't believe that I'm getting any better, any better
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
I’m pretty sure that few would notice
And this apartment is starving for an argument
Anything at all to break the silence
Wandering this house
Like I've never wanted out
And this is about as social as I get now
And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you
Cause they would never do
I would never do, never
But don't be a liar
Don't say that "everything's working"
When everything's broken
And you smile like a saint
But you curse like a sailor
And your eyes say the joke's on me
I’m not laughing, you’re not leaving
Well, who do I think I am kidding
When I’m the only one locked in this cellConsider the odds
Consider the obvious
The martyr is meaningless
The campaign has died
In the planning stages and the fallen faces
Are the singular proof it was ever alive
This purchased rebellion has been outbidded
Denounced and rescinded and left to die championless
I begged you not to go
I begged you, I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
Hope has sprung a perfect dive
A perfect day, a perfect lie
A slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat
Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight?
Basking in your victory, hollow and alone
You boast your bitter bragging rights to anyone who'll listen
While you're left with nothing tangible to gainWhich of the bold faced lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy, you really deserve it
This will be the best for us both in the end
But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you
But this new diet's liquid
And dulling to the senses
And it's crude but it will do
So which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you
I've just been so busy
We'll catch up soon
Let's make it a point to
But it will do
I hope it will doSo quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
Close lipped, another good night kiss
Is robbed of all its passion
Your grip another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
I’ll wait until tomorrow
Maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again
Out of the corner of your eye
Won't be the only way you'll look at me then
So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticedBuried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming beautiful exterior
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect posture but you're barely scraping by
But this is one time, this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you’ve come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most
Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping byWalking away
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now that you've run this in the ground?
And you say “take this
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die”
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted
Begging to be used
And so are you
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing outCome on home and let yourself heal
You could sleep for a thousand years
I won't let you disappear
Let your heart beat here
You've been running far and wide
Doing what you hope is right
Chasing what you feel inside
I will take your path as mine
I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows
So loud and so clear
Let your heart beat here
Let your heart beat here
Winter's come to take me away
I wear my ring to know what's at stake
And when the day's work at their own pace
You remain my time and place
I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows
So loud and so clear
Let your heart beat here
So loud and so clear
Let your heart beat here
Yeah, let your heart beat here
We found our way past our youthful fears
And fought our way through the pain and tears
And we drove our stakes in the place most deep
And let our hearts beat...
I feel it in my ribs
Feel it in my soul
The pulse just grows
So loud and so clear
Let your heart beat here
So loud and so clear
Let your heart beat here
Yeah, let your heart beat here
Let your heart beat hereShe said, "I've got to be honest
You're wasting your time if you're fishing around here."
And I said, "You must be mistaken
I'm not foolin', this feelin' is real."
She said, "You've gotta be crazy!
What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark?"
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But I swear that you've got me all wrong, all wrong, all wrong
That you've got me..."
I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you if just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And I said, "I've got to be honest, I've been waiting for you all my life."
For so long I thought I was asylum bound
But just seeing you makes me think twice
And being with you here makes me sane
I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But are you brave enough to leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight?
You've got me..."
I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you if just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And this is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And this is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?We were the kids that left home probably too young
But we took our share and maybe then some
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this
That somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way outAnd this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway
There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no
Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anywayWish I could write songs about anything other than death
But I can't go to bed without drawing the red, shaving off breaths;
Each one so heavy, each one so cumbersome
Each one a lead weight hanging between my lungs
Spilling my guts
Sweat on a microphone, breaking my voice
Whenever I'm alone with you, can't talk but
"Isn't this weather nice? Are you okay?"
Should I go somewhere else and hide my face?
A sprinter learning to wait
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprained
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprainedFor all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourselfI started using again
Left my heart in rocky hill and a whole burning in bed
Needed a distraction from my head
Devil on my shoulder said try this instead
So I started using again
I started sleeping again
Traded late nights and sheep for vicodin
The guilt burning in my chest set in
I started sleeping again
I stopped wishing I was dead
Learned to love myself before anyone else
Become more than just a burden
I know I'm more than worthy of your time
I started smoking again
Guess I missed coughing my lungs up every morning
Needed anything to keep my breathing
To prevent my blood from bleeding
I started smoking again
I started loving again
Thought when I lost that will to live I could never feel again
I'll give it one more shot and let someone in
I Started loving again
I started loving again
I started loving again
I started loving again
I stopped wishing I was dead
Learned to love myself before anyone else
Become more than just a burden
I know I'm more than worthy of your timeI made my slow way home
Limpin' on broken bones
Out of the thickest part
Across the county lines
Onto your wooden stairs
I know you can't repair
I know you've seen the light
I know you'll get me right
Right, right, right
I own a sinner's heart
I know the rain falls hard
I know the currency
I know the things you'll need
I hope He hears my prayers
I see you cut your hair
I know the saving type
I know you'll get me right
Right, right, right
Oh Jesus, I've fallen
I don't mind the rain if
I meet my maker
I meet my maker
Clearly, Jesus
The truth is
I struggle so hard to believe
I need my maker, I need my maker
To cure me of my darling gun
And drain me of the sins I love
And take from me my disbelief
I know it should come easily
But it remains inside of me
It battles and devours me
It cuddles up the side of me
In whispers, it convinces me I'm
Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, rightIt was the year I crashed my motorbike
I think it was the summer
I think you whispered
"When you gonna wake up? When you gonna wake up?"
Dear, slip these on your tongue
Little seeds of reinvention
In angels hands the medicine
Of modern man
Wait now
Tell me that this isn't over
Hang on, just long enough
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
Even if it's just 'till morning
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
Stay here and we can start again
We could be made over
You'll hear us shouting
"When you gonna wake up? When you gonna wake up?"
Scared, well, everyone gets scared
Just signal when you're ready
In angel's hands
Sleep to steady, sleep so steady
Wait now
Tell me that this isn't over
Hang on, just long enough
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
Even if it's just 'till morning
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
If you're running from your secrets
I won't make you take them with you
I'm ready I can take it
You don't have to carry them alone
There's a way out if you want it
To an end or a new beginning
You just have to find it on your own
If this is heaven
Or if it's just a warning
Say you will stay with me
If this is over then
Why is it so hard?
Just say you will stay with me
One more night
One more night
(If this is over)
One more night
(Or if it's just a warning)
Even if it's just 'till morning
One more night
(If this is over then)
One more night
(Why is it so hard?)
One more night
(Say you will stay with me)
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morning
Even if it's just 'till morningWe went rolling up the coast
Then there was no more coast to wander
We tried every different road
Just to see which took us further
We were living on the run
Though there was no one chasing after
We were looking out for love
And we were flirting with disaster
While the world fades out
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We stayed on the run too long
Hoping we'd never return
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down into cinders
We turned out into the plains
And turned in when we got tired
We slept two across the bench
And we fit three under the covers
We had just enough cash left
To top the tank and fill the cooler
And we lit the van with dreams
After the sun burned into cinders
And the world fades out
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We stayed on the run too long
Hoping we'd never return
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders, into cinders
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders
We stayed in the sun too long
Suffered a terrible burn
Now everybody learns from disaster
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cinders, into cinders
We watched the sun burn down
We watched the sun burn down into cindersDown in a local bar out on the Boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back like you never broke, you tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks he's getting close
For now you let him
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
In all your silver rings, in all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back here you never lost, you shake the shivers off
You take a drink to get your courage up
Can you believe it?
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, oh keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on
Down in a local bar out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't turn turn away
Let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the BoulevardWell, I know the trouble when the trouble starts
And I know the signals of a straying heart
And I know the stirrings of a double cross
And I see suspicions arise around you
I know the chatter as it starts to creep
I know the walls as they ring and repeat
I know the secrets they were meant to keep
And I see suspicions arise
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
I know about you
I know the ceiling when it starts to burn
And I know the season when it starts to turn
And I know the patterns that the wicked learn
And I see suspicions arise around you
I know the curtain and the way it falls
I know the burden and the pain it draws
I know you're sorry for something
But I don't know why
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about you
It's a shame, I know
But it all shakes out real slow
When the forays of your weekend
Hang like smoke onto your clothes
And the shame of it grows
When you whisper it nice and low
But all the walls have ears my darling
And all bad things get known
And I know about you
I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about you
(I know about you)
I know about youI know that yesterday is gone
And it won't come back to me
But I miss it after all
It never really lasts as long
As it meant for it to be
Well the twists and turns
They're pulling us and tearing to the seams
But I'll meet you where we started once again
'Cause I miss you
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
We're only waiting on the sun
To clear away the haze
'Cause we can't see where we've gone
From where we started, where we strayed
And where we're meant to be
There'll be ash and dust to bury us
But I will keep you clean
And I'll meet you where we started once again
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the best is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
And when tomorrow comes
And we've shown everyone
What they can never take awayI lay down, I can't sleep
My mind runs on repeat
I stare at the ceiling from my side
I reach out, you're right there
But you're lost in the details
I wait for the end of the long night
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need you more than you know now
We play like we don't know
We both lie, but we don't show
It's something that's changing between us
You start out in one lane
The same road, the same name
But something we can't see divides us
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need you more than you know now
'Cause I need you more than you know now
'Cause I need you more than you know now
(Don't run away, don't run away)
'Cause I need you more than you know now
(Don't run away, don't run away)
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it anyway it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can we take it? Can we save it?
Sick of keeping, tired of waiting
Can we hold down? Can you hold on?
'Cause I need this more than ever
'Cause I need you more than you know nowEven now, I can smell your clothes
Freshly from the wash
Still hot from the dryer
Even now, I can smell your skin
As I wrap you in a towel
Lay you on the bed
And try to love you
Even now, I can feel your arms
I can feel your breast
I can hear your songs
And I always can find you again
Even now, I can feel your hand
Gently over mine
With almost no weight at all
Even now, I can feel your eyes
Watch me as I strum
Much too late at night
Even now, I can see you smile
I can hear you hum
I can hear you sing
And I always can find you again
Even in the dark of night
Even in the lowest light
Even as the world outside
Is spinning and spinning
Even now, I can feel your hair
Blow across my cheek
As we sit in one of two chairs
Even now, I can feel your face
Resting on my chest
Wrestling for sleep
And failing at it
Even now, I can see you sleep
I can see you dream
I can see you fly
And I always can find you again
And I always can find you againFrom small pains to fiery burns
These are the signals of my dying nerves
Singed by the heat of your lines and curves
Into a fire that could scorch the earth
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through them, but I can't remember how to feel
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
From small shocks to surging bolts
These are the signals from my spinal cords
Sent down the wires through the lines and folds
Into a wire on my frontal lobe
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through them, but I can't remember how to feel
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to impulses of science
If this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Oh, if this is chemical, oh, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
(I can't remember how to feel)
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
If this is chemical, if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of scienceI sit and wonder of your pause
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine?
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
And all is quiet and all your looks
Give no betrayal to what you shield or hide
Wider walls
Have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will protect your burning heart
I know your careful
'Cause I've been burned before and I know how it makes you careful
And I know your symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone, are you lonely?
Well, you just don't have to be
Lonely anymore
I don't like the looks of this
Without you there's no truth
But all my doubt and all my trust
Is no betrayal to what I feel inside
Wider walls
Have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will defend your beating heart
And I know your careful
'Cause I've been burned before and I know how that makes you careful
And I know yours symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone, are you lonely?
Well, you just don't have to be
Lonely anymore
I sit and wonder of your thoughts
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine?
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad newsThere's things I know
I should've mentioned sooner
But I didn't know how I'm sorry I lost you
I never thought that this could come between us
I know it's water and bridges now
But what's the sense of carrying around this weight?
These words are tearing me apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
That face, I know exactly what you're thinking
But I'm certain this time is different
And that's why I can't pretend that everything is mended
I know, I've tried to, for too long now
But what's the sense in carrying around this weight?
These words are tearing us apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
Oh, save me from a gray life
Oh, save me from the gray life
I've paid the price with my soul
Oh, save me
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a lot to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chance, if I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chanceA line of strands to mark the trail
No one said it would be easy
I must admit I thought the risk
Was better waged in younger seasons
And all these years in the cold play hell on the throat
'Till everything I say burns like cinders
Well, it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the crease of a strangling winter
It's strange to be lost, stranger to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
Along the way the turns are sharp
No one said it would be easy
I must admit, I thought the trip
Was better made in younger seasons
But all these years in pursuit made a man of a fool
'Till every word I say is unwavered
Well, it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the case of a selfish believer
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
Well it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
In the case of a selfish believer
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings of a twisting line
And when the path I have made from the grass to the grave
I will love you still
And when the sand turns to glass and all that's left is the past
I will love you stillBreathe in for luck
Breathe in so deep
This air is blessed
You share with me
This night is wild
So calm and dull
These hearts they race
From self control
Your legs are smooth
As they graze mine
We're doing fine
We're doing nothing at all
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
The words are hushed
Lets not get busted
Just lay entwined here
Undiscovered
Safe in here
From all the stupid questions
"Hey, did you get some?"
Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
Hands down
This is the best day
I can ever remember
I'll always remember
The sound of the stereo
The dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair
That you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock
When we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared
Together
The streets were wet
And the gate was locked
So I jumped it
And I let you in
And you stood at your door
With your hands on my waist
And you kissed me
Like you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
That you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant itSo this is odd
Painful realization
That all has gone wrong
And nobody cares at all
And nobody cares at all
So you buried all your lover's clothes
And burned the letters lover wrote
But it doesn't make it any better
Does it make it any better?
And the plaster dented from your fist
In the hall where you had your first kiss
Reminds you that the memories will fade
So this is strange
Our sidestepping has come to be
A brilliant dance
Where nobody leads at all
Where nobody leads at all
And the picture frames are facing down
And the ringing from this empty sound
Is deafening and keeping you from sleep
And breathing is a foreign task
And thinking's just too much to ask
And you're measuring your minutes
By a clock that's blinking eights
Well, this is incredible
Starving, insatiable
Yes, this is love for the first time
And you'd like to think that you were invincible
Yeah, well weren't we all once
Before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last timeI'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets
But you’re not alone and you’re not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home
I'm reading your note over again
There’s not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it "I will love you always & forever."
As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder how you're making out
And as for me I wish that I was anywhere with anyone making out
I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you’re pretending
I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets
And I am alone in my defeat
I wish I knew you are safely at home
I'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wearI heard about your trip
I heard about your souvenirs
I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights
And the cool guys that you spent them with
I guess I should have heard of them from you
Don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over?
And all the "Best Deceptions" and the  "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service
To keeping you away
I heard about your regrets
I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
I'll be all right when my hands get warm
Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing
I'd rather you'd never heard my voice
You’re calling too late, too late to be gracious and you do not warrant long good-byesThis ruined puzzle is beige with the pieces all face down
So the placing goes slowly
The pictures of anything other than it's meant to be
But the hours, they creep, the patterns repeat
Don't be concerned, you know I'll be fine on my own
I never said "don't go", “don’t go”
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back
It says "Does he ever get the girl?"
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?
Well, this basement's a coffin, I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe
Cause you're gone, I get nothing
And you're off with barely a sigh
I never said "Good-bye"
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you read if you’re so inclined
"Does he ever get the girl?"
Does he ever get the girl?This is where I say I've had enough
And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now
A walking open wound
A trophy display of bruises
And I don't believe that I'm getting any better, any better
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
I’m pretty sure that few would notice
And this apartment is starving for an argument
Anything at all to break the silence
Wandering this house
Like I've never wanted out
And this is about as social as I get now
And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you
Cause they would never do
I would never do, never
But don't be a liar
Don't say that "everything's working"
When everything's broken
And you smile like a saint
But you curse like a sailor
And your eyes say the joke's on me
I’m not laughing, you’re not leaving
Well, who do I think I am kidding
When I’m the only one locked in this cellConsider the odds
Consider the obvious
The martyr is meaningless
The campaign has died
In the planning stages and the fallen faces
Are the singular proof it was ever alive
This purchased rebellion has been outbidded
Denounced and rescinded and left to die championless
I begged you not to go
I begged you, I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
Hope has sprung a perfect dive
A perfect day, a perfect lie
A slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat
Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight?
Basking in your victory, hollow and alone
You boast your bitter bragging rights to anyone who'll listen
While you're left with nothing tangible to gainWhich of the bold faced lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy, you really deserve it
This will be the best for us both in the end
But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you
But this new diet's liquid
And dulling to the senses
And it's crude but it will do
So which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you
I've just been so busy
We'll catch up soon
Let's make it a point to
But it will do
I hope it will doSo quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
Close lipped, another good night kiss
Is robbed of all its passion
Your grip another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
I’ll wait until tomorrow
Maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again
Out of the corner of your eye
Won't be the only way you'll look at me then
So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticedBuried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming beautiful exterior
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect posture but you're barely scraping by
But this is one time, this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you’ve come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most
Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping byWalking away
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now that you've run this in the ground?
And you say “take this
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die”
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted
Begging to be used
And so are you
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing outIt’s yet to be determined
But the air is thick, and my hope is feeling worn
I'm missing home, and I'm glad you're not a part of this
There’s parts of me that will be missed
And the phone is always dead to me
So I can't tell you the temperature is dropping
And it feels like it’s colder than it ought to be in March
And I still got a day or two ahead of me
Till I'll be heading home into your arms again
And the people here are asking after you
It doesn't make it easier
It doesn't make it easier to be away
I'd like to hire a plane
I'd see you in the morning when the day is fresh
I'm coming home again
It’s warmer where you're waiting
It feels more like July
There's pillows in their cases and one of those is mine
And you wrote the words I love you, and sprayed it with perfume
It’s better than the fire is to heat this lonely room
It’s warmer where you’re waiting
It feels more like July
